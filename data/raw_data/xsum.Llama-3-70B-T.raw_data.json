They are silent and kids can change the tension so if they feel they have more energy they can crank up the tension. \"Within a week some students started to say they thought they were focusing more and Ms Lambeth noticed that they were more engaged in conversation in class. \"They were able to recall a lot more of what I was saying and because they participated more they understood more and they did better in tests. \"As a result she says their test grades demonstrably improved from when the pedals were introduced in April compared to earlier in the school year.Other teachers using the same classroom have also noticed an improvement in students' grades and parents have reported that their children were more interested in just being in the class.The pedals cost $180 (\u00c2\u00a3138) each and were bought with a grant from the local Wake County Public School System.Now the school is hoping to buy more pedals and extend the programme.Staff who work with youngsters on the behavioural support programme area are also interested in seeing if they can make a difference for them.By Annie Flury, UGC and Social News team.",

Wagg's versatility and ability to adapt to different situations made him a valuable asset to the team.Craig Meschede, the South African-born seamer, completed the quartet of fast bowlers, taking 35 wickets in a season that saw him continue to develop as a bowler. Meschede's ability to generate pace and bounce made him a handful for opposing batsmen, and his performances will have given the Glamorgan coaching staff plenty of encouragement for the future.The collective efforts of these four fast bowlers were instrumental in Glamorgan's success in 2016, and their performances will be crucial if the team is to build on last season's achievements. With a strong pace attack, Glamorgan will be looking to make a push for honors in the upcoming season. As the new season approaches, Glamorgan's coaching staff will be buoyed by the knowledge that they have a potent pace attack at their disposal. The quartet of van der Gugten, Hogan, Wagg, and Meschede will be looking to build on their impressive performances from last season, and with a bit of luck and some favorable weather conditions, they could be a force to be reckoned with in the upcoming campaign.One of the key factors that contributed to Glamorgan's success last season was the ability of their fast bowlers to take wickets on a variety of surfaces."

        "text": "\"There were good announcements about smart TVs, 4k TVs and other connected devices,\" said Ichiro Ishiguro, an analyst at Hermes who has been coming to CES for 10 years. \"It sounds like they are doing what they have to do and are progressing as expected, but on the other hand there was nothing much surprising or exciting about the announcement today. \"Samsung said its smart TV interface had been redesigned to be \"more visually appealing\".Users now swipe through five panels which take them between shows being broadcast at that time; on-demand programmes and movies; photos and other content sourced from connectable devices; social networks and Skype; and finally smart TV apps.The system also uses a facility called S Recommendation to suggest content based on the owner's past viewing habits which can take account of the way their choices change at different times of the day.A new T-commerce service will also allow users to identify the clothes stars are wearing and order their own copy of the outfit on selected programmes.To offer the new functionality Samsung has upgraded the equipment's computer processor.Owners of the previous generation TVs will be offered an upgrade hardware pack which they can slot into the back of their set, making good on a promise made last year.Brandon Hill, editor of the Dailytech blog, said that while much of the technology was impressive it would probably remain too expensive for \"normal people\" for years to come.However, he thought the ability for two people to watch different shows at once might prove popular once it eventually became available to displays targeted at the mass market. \"It might save a few marriages even though it seems a bit gimmicky,\" he said. \"It will definitely filter down to the consumer market but it will just be a few years before we see it there. I guess it's a nice thing to show at CES but for 'real people' it doesn't mean much now. \"Samsung's event also introduced new smart devices for the kitchen.They included a fridge-freezer featuring a compartment that can be switched between the the two states, and an oven that can cook two meals at different temperatures.",

The incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of prioritizing safety in educational institutions and ensuring that all necessary measures are taken to protect the lives of students."

He's a good young player, has a bright future ahead of him but I don't pick my team around what the supporters sing at the games. \"It is the tactical nous O'Neill has displayed that has won him more admirers out in France.His bold decision to make five changes and switch his system for the game with Ukraine ultimately sent Northern Ireland through and club chairmen will have been impressed by the way his players were well-drilled to stop Robert Lewandowski and Gareth Bale.Despite recently signing a four-year deal with the team after delivering major tournament football for the first time in 30 years, a \u00a3750,000 release clause in O'Neill's contract would not be a huge deterrent to the bigger clubs in England and Scotland should they identify him as a potential manager. \"There's going to be people who are looking at him,\" said his captain Steven Davis. \"He has done a hell of job here with us. We've had unbelievable progression in the last couple of years. We are unlucky not to be going to the quarter-finals. \"I'm sure there are a lot of clubs who are thinking he is a suitable candidate for a role. Obviously we would like to keep him, selfishly.

Voting is mandatory in Singapore, with few exemptions allowed.The PAP's main rival - the Workers' Party - ended up with six seats, less than the seven it held in the outgoing parliament. A number of smaller parties also ran.The PAP's success has been attributed to its widespread popularity among Singaporeans - who have seen their country rapidly evolve into a first-world economy - as well as its tight political control.But government stumbles in managing immigration and infrastructure, coupled with a greater desire by younger Singaporeans for political plurality, have led to gains by opposition parties over the years.If the last election was the PAP's nadir, then this one marked its return to glory.In 2011 it scored 60% of the vote share - a good showing by most counts, but it was the party's worst ever performance - thanks to public unhappiness over an influx of foreigners, a housing shortage, and transport breakdowns.It sought to resolve these problems, promised to listen to citizens more, and put in place slightly more generous social welfare policies. On Friday, voters rewarded the party with a bigger mandate.Lingering feel-good vibes from last month's jubilee celebrations, and a renewed sense of gratitude to PAP founder and revered leader Lee Kuan Yew, triggered by his death in March, no doubt also played a part in voters' decisions.The PAP's return to power was widely expected but its large margin was a surprise to many, not least to the main opposition Workers' Party (WP). It campaigned on a platform of providing an effective check on the PAP, but lost a constituency and saw its winning margins reduced in the few seats it retained.The results thus cement the PAP's long-running political dominance in Singapore and highlight the long slog ahead for those pushing for political plurality with an electorate which, for now, appears unconvinced of its merits.Read more: Singapore's elections explained in memes",

        "text": "\"One of the things we found was it's actually very easy to see bubbles forming in stout beer rather than in, say, champagne where the bubble formation process is much more violent,\" Dr Lee told BBC News.But as has happened to a generation of like-minded scientists before them, the question of falling bubbles became their focus.The team had the idea - borne out by calculations carried out by Mr Cummins - that the relative density of bubbles and the surrounding liquid could be behind the phenomenon. \"If you imagine your pint is full of bubbles, then the bubbles will start to rise,\" Dr Lee said.But the bubbles in a standard pint glass find themselves in a different environment as they rise straight up. \"Because of the sloping wall of the pint, the bubbles are moving away from the wall, which means you're getting a much denser region next to the wall,\" Dr Lee explained. \"That is going to sink under its own gravity, because it's less buoyant, and that sinking fluid will pull the bubbles down. \"The bubbles, that is, are \"trying\" to rise, but the circulation that creates drives fluid down at the wall of the glass. \"You'll see sinking bubbles not because the bubbles themselves are sinking, but because the fluid is and it's pulling them down with it. \"The same flow pattern occurs with other beers such as lagers, but the larger bubbles of carbon dioxide are less subject to that drag.Mr Cummins carried out calculations using a simulated pint and \"anti-pint\" - that is, the upside-down version of a pint glass - showing the effect at work; in the anti-pint, the bubbles rise as expected.For those interested in experimenting in the pub, the effect can be best seen if a pint of stout is served in a straight-sided, cylindrical glass (not quite filled up).If the glass is tilted at an angle while the pint settles, the side in the direction of the tilt represents the normal situation of a pint glass, while the opposite side is the \"anti-pint\" - and bubbles can be seen to both rise and fall in the same glass.",

They found that the curved shape of the glass creates a circulation pattern in the liquid, with an upward flow at the center of the glass and a downward flow at the edges. This circulation pattern is responsible for carrying the bubbles down towards the bottom of the glass.The team's simulations showed that the shape of the glass is the key factor in creating this circulation pattern. \"We found that if you change the shape of the glass, the flow pattern changes, and the bubbles no longer sink,\" explained Dr. Benilov.To test their theory, the researchers conducted experiments using a specially designed glass with a modified shape. They found that the bubbles in this glass did not sink, confirming their simulation results.The study's findings have implications not only for our understanding of fluid dynamics but also for the brewing industry. \"Our research could help brewers optimize the design of their glasses to enhance the drinking experience,\" said Dr. Cummins.For beer enthusiasts, the study offers a simple test to verify the researchers' findings. \"Next time you're enjoying a pint of stout, try tilting the glass slightly to disrupt the circulation pattern,\" suggested Dr. Lee. \"If the bubbles start rising instead of sinking, you'll know that our theory is correct!\"The study's results have been published on the Arxiv server and are set to be published in a leading physics journal.

        "text": "\"They will be poised to respond to any missile threats to our allies or our territory,\" Pentagon spokesman George Little said.On Tuesday Pyongyang announced plans to restart its main Yongbyon nuclear complex, which Mr Kerry said would be a \"provocative and serious\" move.Earlier, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the crisis had \"gone too far\" and called for urgent talks with the North. \"Things must begin to calm down, there is no need for the DPRK [North Korea] to be on a collision course with the international community. Nuclear threats are not a game,\" Mr Ban said.The US has urged China and Russia to apply pressure on Pyongyang to change its Yongbyon plans.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei called for restraint from all sides to resolve the \"complex and sensitive\" situation.Russia's foreign ministry, meanwhile, warned against escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula. \"The main objective is to avoid the forceful military scenario. It is not acceptable to use the situation there (on the Korean peninsula) to try to reach someone's specific military and political aims,\" said ministry spokesman Grigoriy Logvinov.By Kim GhattasBBC state department correspondentNorth Korea - a vexing problem for the USThe BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul says Yongbyon has provided the North with successful leverage in the past.The complex offers Pyongyang two ways of making nuclear bombs - a uranium enrichment facility, and a nuclear reactor, from which the spent fuel can be turned into plutonium.Restarting it gives the regime several cards to play: it secures more material for its nuclear programme, and also re-focuses world attention on how to stop it, our correspondent says.The reactor at Yongbyon - which was the source for plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons programme - was closed in July 2007 as part of a disarmament-for-aid deal.The cooling tower at the facility was later destroyed, but then the disarmament deal stalled.Part of the reason the agreement fell apart was because the US did not believe Pyongyang was fully disclosing all of its nuclear facilities - a suspicion later bolstered when North Korea unveiled a uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon to US scientist Siegfried Hecker in 2010.While it appeared to be for electricity generation purposes, Mr Hecker said the facility could be readily converted to produce highly-enriched uranium for bombs.In a November 2010 report following his visit to Yongbyon, Mr Hecker said that based on what he saw, he believed North Korea could \"resume all plutonium operations within approximately six months\" at Yongbyon if so inclined.",

Mr Obama has attempted to have them brought to the US for trial.However, only one Guantanamo inmate has been transferred to the US for trial. Tanzanian Ahmed Ghailani was jailed for life in 2011 before Congress barred the transfer of any others.Politicians from both parties have said that Guantanamo prisoners do not belong on US soil or in civilian prisons, arguing they are too dangerous.Afghans, Saudis and Yemenis have made up more than 60% of the prisoners, although about 50 different nationalities have been represented.The vast majority of the 779 inmates were released under the previous administration of George W Bush. Nine have died at the prison.Mr Obama has approved regular releases, totalling 161, with detainees heading for resettlement around the world.Only 61 prisoners remain, of whom 20 are approved for release. The key figures left (all of whom have been charged and are currently in pre-trial hearings) are:Figures from the office of the director of national intelligence show that, of the inmates released under George W Bush, 21% were confirmed to have re-engaged in militant activity, while 14% were suspected of having done so.Of the releases under President Obama, only 5% were confirmed to have re-engaged in militant activity and 8% were suspected of having done so.Many of those released have simply returned to their homelands. Many returning Afghans harbour resentment both at why they were sent to Guantanamo Bay and their treatment there. Many still report harassment by security forces although they insist they pose no threat.Among the countries taking inmates in releases under Mr Obama are the UAE, Georgia, Senegal, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Morocco, the UK, Mauritania, Oman, Bosnia, Montenegro, Algeria, Kazakhstan, Uruguay, Estonia and El Salvador.Inevitably the results have been mixed, given cultural differences.Uruguay took six Arab men in December 2014 but later said it would take no more, arguing the ex-inmates had struggled to adapt to the country.One inmate, Abu Bakker Qassi, a Uighur from north-western China, found himself working as a pizza chef cooking halal Italian food in Albania.",

The team has failed to score in their last four matches, and their lack of creativity in front of goal is becoming a major concern. Parkinson's men have now gone six games without a win, and the pressure is mounting on the manager to turn things around.The match itself was a tightly contested affair, with both teams creating chances in the early stages. However, it was Oxford United who eventually broke the deadlock through Josh Maguire's clinical finish in the 81st minute. The goal seemed to spark the U's into life, and they doubled their lead just six minutes later through Josh Thomas's well-taken strike.Bolton Wanderers pushed hard for a way back into the game, but Oxford United's defense held firm to secure the clean sheet. The win is a massive boost for the U's, who will look to build on this momentum as they face a tough run of fixtures in the coming weeks.In other news, Oxford United's Josh Maguire was named man of the match for his impressive performance, which included his goal and several other chances created throughout the game. The striker's form has been a key factor in Oxford's recent upturn in fortunes, and he will be looking to continue his hot streak in the coming matches.The defeat for Bolton Wanderers means they remain stuck in 18th place in the League One table, just three points above the relegation zone. The pressure is mounting on Parkinson to turn things around, and the team's next match against high-flying Bradford City will be a crucial one in their bid to avoid the drop.In the meantime, Oxford United will be looking to build on their momentum as they face a trip to struggling Shrewsbury Town next weekend. With confidence high and their first away win under their belts, the U's will be looking to make it back-to-back victories and continue their climb up the League One table.",

Assisted by Kane Hemmings.Bolton Wanderers 0, Oxford United 1. Josh Thomas (Oxford United) right footed shot from the center of the box to the bottom left corner. Assisted by Alex MacDonald.Second Half ends, Bolton Wanderers 0, Oxford United 2.Oxford United's first away win since promotion from League Two was a hard-fought one, but ultimately a deserved one. The U's dominated possession and created the better chances throughout the match, with Josh Maguire and Josh Thomas scoring in the final nine minutes to seal the win.Bolton Wanderers, on the other hand, will be disappointed with their performance. They failed to seriously test Oxford goalkeeper Simon Eastwood, despite using six different strikers during the course of the game. The Trotters have now failed to score in their last four matches and have not won a game since Phil Parkinson was named manager of the month for August.The win lifts Oxford United to 12th in the League One table, while Bolton Wanderers remain in 18th place.In his post-match interview, Oxford United manager Michael Appleton praised his team's performance, saying \"I'm delighted with the win. We dominated the game and created the better chances. The lads worked hard and deserved the three points.\"Bolton Wanderers manager Phil Parkinson, on the other hand, was left to rue his team's lack of creativity in front of goal. \"We didn't create enough chances and didn't test their goalkeeper enough. We need to work on our attacking play and get back to winning ways as soon as possible.\" The victory marks a significant milestone for Oxford United, who have struggled to find their footing in League One since their promotion from League Two. The win is a testament to the team's growing confidence and cohesion, and Appleton's tactics seemed to pay off as his side controlled the tempo of the game from start to finish.For Bolton Wanderers, the defeat is a worrying sign of their recent slump. The team has failed to score in their last four matches, and their lack of creativity in front of goal is becoming a major concern. Parkinson's men have now gone six games without a win, and the pressure is mounting on the manager to turn things around.The match itself was a tightly contested affair, with both teams creating chances in the early stages."

UKIP's anti-EU stance has been a central plank of their campaign, and their success is likely to embolden eurosceptics across the country.\"This result is a clear message to the government that voters are fed up with the EU's interference in our affairs,\" said UKIP's leader."

Some experience depressive symptoms only briefly, others have remitting and relapsing depression and some people are depressed all the time.Dr Simon Ridley, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said anyone concerned about either condition should seek help. \"The findings suggest that low levels of depression or fluctuating symptoms may not affect dementia risk but that a worsening of symptoms in the over-55s may be an early indicator of diseases like Alzheimer's,\" he said. \"It's important to remember that only a relatively small number of people experiencing symptoms of depression went on to develop dementia during this 11-year study, but anyone concerned about either condition should talk to their GP.\"",

        "first_sentence": "The Championship club will make an announcement \"in due course\" on a new head coach and backroom team.Portuguese Nuno Espirito Santo, 43, an ex-goalkeeper who has left his post at Porto, is his anticipated replacement.As well as Lambert, 47, coaches Stuart Taylor and Rob Edwards, their former player, and another ex-player Tony Daley, fitness coach and head of sport science, are also leaving.Lambert is the fifth of Wolves' past six first-team bosses to last less than a year at Molineux.His role had been in doubt since the end of the Championship season over a dispute about who has the final say on signing players.The decision was made as part of a coaching restructure by Wolves' Chinese owners Fosun following an end-of-season football review.Fosun have had a close working relationship with Portuguese agent Jorge Mendes since their takeover in July 2016.Several of their 12 summer signings were arranged by Mendes, although the majority of them struggled to make an impact at Molineux.The one undoubted success was winger Helder Costa, who initially joined on loan from Benfica at the start of the season before completing a club-record \u00a313m move in January.Costa ended 2016-17 as Wolves' top scorer with 12 goals and swept the board at the club's end-of-season awards.Lambert had spoken publicly of his desire to sign mainly British players this summer.",
        "text": "But reports of the Scot considering his future as a result of his unease with Mendes' sizeable involvement in Wolves' recruitment policy first surfaced earlier this month.Since the Premier League was launched in 1992, Wolves have spent just four of those 25 seasons in the top flight.They first won promotion under Dave Jones in 2003, only to come straight back down again.They then went back up again as champions under Mick McCarthy in 2009, spending three seasons there this time.Over the last 10 seasons, only one manager has taken over a Championship club in the summer, having finished the previous season at the same level, and then won automatic promotion in his first season.That was Steve Bruce, with Hull City in 2012-13 - and with a points haul (79) that would not have been good enough to make this season's play-offs.Having been appointed as Walter Zenga's successor on 5 November, Lambert was in charge for 33 matches in all competitions, of which Wolves won 14, lost 14 and drew five.A run of five successive league defeats in February dragged Wolves into a Championship relegation struggle, although they pulled well clear of the bottom three with five consecutive wins in March and April.They eventually finished 15th, seven points clear of the relegation zone.The highlights of Lambert's reign came in the FA Cup, in which Wolves won at Premier League opponents Stoke City and Liverpool before losing at home to double-chasing Chelsea in the fifth round.Media playback is not supported on this deviceBBC WM's Mike TaylorThe news of Lambert's departure is not surprising, since it is now three weeks since reports of the apparent rift between him and the club first appeared, although no public comment confirming it was ever made by either side.Neither will it be a surprise when, and we expect it will probably be Wednesday, Nuno Espirito Santo is announced as his replacement.This decision by Wolves can be viewed either as a bold step forward with a fresh approach, or another unnecessary risk on a coach with no experience of a particularly treacherous league.What it does appear to make abundantly clear, though, is that the owners Fosun are very much influenced by the agent Jorge Mendes, to a greater degree than they have previously been prepared to admit. Lambert was never going to stand for that.Fans will have their own views on whether that is the right course. The opinions of the club's director Jeff Shi may also turn out to be of interest, given the enthusiastic language he used to describe Lambert's vital importance to the club's management team only a few weeks ago.",

They are a cancer and they need to be cut out. \"The UKIP leader also called for the government to reverse the cuts to police numbers (nearly 20,000), to put 4,000 more people into the border force and 7,000 more prison officers. He says \"radicalisation is rife in prisons\".Mr Nuttall said he would not be under pressure to step down if he won no seats on Thursday, noting that UKIP was at its \"most influential, [when] we didn't have an MP\" and Nigel Farage still remained leader.He would not say how many seats he hopes to win, but predicted, \"we'll get over the line in a number of seats, but our vote share will go down\".",

There, the Socialist candidate rejected his party's call to pull out.French regions have wide powers over local transport, education and economic development.The far right has been steadily gaining votes over the past few years from both left- and right-wing sympathisers through a mix of nationalist and pro-welfare policies, correspondents say.In the lead-up to the first round, opinion polls suggested that the popularity of the anti-immigration, anti-EU FN had increased since the deadly attacks in Paris on 13 November.Who were Paris attackers?How the Paris attacks unfoldedThe FN is hoping a strong performance will boost Marine Le Pen's chances in the 2017 presidential election.The government's response to the Paris attacks has boosted President Hollande's approval ratings - they have soared more than 30 percentage points to 50%.However, this surge in personal popularity has so far not translated into greater approval for Mr Hollande's Socialist Party.",

Ultimately, that could mean the dismantling of a 160 year old financial institution and the biggest financial rescue since 2009.To be clear, we are not at that point yet.Potential buyers have until 4 April to submit their bids for the company and there are the options already discussed to raise money after that date. Financial markets are betting heavily against Co-op Bank's survival in its current form, BUT the fact that its bonds are worth anything at all means some investors still think Bank of England intervention is avoidable.Co-op customers have very little to fear as current accounts, personal loans and mortgages would be taken on by another bank if necessary and deposits up to \u00a385,000 are guaranteed by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.Customers of the ethically focused Co-op bank have been very loyal during a period which has seen big losses, branch closures and a drug scandal involving its former non-executive chairman, Paul Flowers dent the financial and ethical integrity of Co-op bank.It may yet live to fight on, but the Bank of England is braced for its failure.",

Non-Muslims were singled out to be killed.Mr Timamy belongs to a political affiliate of Mr Kenyatta's governing Jubilee coalition.He will remain in police custody until 30 June, while investigations continue.The attacks earlier in June killed at least 60 people, as gunmen descended on hotels and a police station.It was the most deadly attack in Kenya since last September, when at least 67 people were killed by al-Shabab fighters at Nairobi's Westgate shopping centre.Analysis: Emmanuel Igunza, BBC News, MombasaGovernor Timamy is a high-profile politician, so the case has attracted much interest.Senior politicians from the coastal region accompanied him to court while supporters thronged the court precincts in a show of solidarity.The charges levelled against Mr Timamy are perhaps an indication of how serious the government wants to stick to its line - that local politics were behind the killings.But it is not clear why a politician affiliated to the ruling coalition would be the first target of arrests.Most of the people killed in the attacks were ethnic Kikuyus.

Taxis, delivery vehicles, buses and emergency vehicles are still allowed.Initially some drivers complained that the move was not well publicised and claimed the signs warning of the bus gate were inadequate.Some also wrongly assumed that the gate was a temporary measure during the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games.If a motorist issued with a notice pays up within 14 days, they are charged \u00a330 - and most do pay up within a fortnight. If they pay up later, they are charged \u00a360.Councils across Scotland are adamant bus gates are only put in place to help the environment and public transport, and strongly deny claims from opponents that they are a source of revenue.Even the \u00a31.3m from Nelson Mandela Place is still a drop in the ocean compared to Glasgow City Council's annual budget of more than \u00a32bn.In July and August last year, 30,000 notices were issued to motorists.The number then fell substantially in September to 5,000 and has gradually declined since.Approximately 10,000 notices were served between April and July this year - 2,334 of them last month. If all the motorists who received a notice last month pay up within 30 days, the fines will total \u00a370,000.Councillor Alistair Watson, Glasgow City Council's executive member for Sustainability and Transport, said: \"One of the aims of the bus gate is to reduce the number of vehicles travelling through the city centre, while improving provision for public transport. \"There is always a period of adjustment when new restrictions are introduced. It's clear from the reduction in offences that drivers are aware of the bus lanes and have modified the route they take. \"The majority of the city's drivers won't receive bus lane charges since they don't drive through what is now a well-known and very visible bus gate. \"The number of offences has dropped significantly and hopefully we will see even further reductions. Most drivers contravening the bus gate pay the penalty within 14 days which reduces their fine to \u00a330. \"In 2013, Edinburgh City Council received \u00a3718,000 from bus lane fines while Aberdeen City Council received \u00a3896,000.That year Glasgow received a total of \u00a33,283,776.",

One is so affronted he stands up in the House of Commons and accuses his government of \"polishing a poo\". Such is the elevation of political discourse that the European Union engenders.And yet David Cameron is on his feet at a factory in Wiltshire claiming the draft reform deal published by Donald Tusk would leave Britain \"better off, more secure, more prosperous\". The settlement, the prime minister said, gave Britain the \"best of worlds\" and that was \"something worth fighting for\".So yes, Mr Cameron may have to spend the next two weeks twisting arms in Europe, there may be no guarantee of a deal and everyone is agreed that nothing is agreed until everything agreed.But the prime minister is already in campaign mode, bouncing around tiggerishly in his shirtsleeves, selling his deal almost as if it had been agreed.There will be an emergency brake on in-work benefits imposed on EU migrants, they will be able to send less child benefit home, there will be greater protection for businesses from the Eurozone, parliaments will get more powers to block EU laws, the UK will escape further political integration within the EU, there are legally binding promises to make the EU more competitive.And there will be changes to make it easier for the UK to exclude terror suspects even if there is no imminent threat.So here's the point. However much this package is diluted or changed in coming weeks, Mr Cameron now believes he will have enough of a deal to sell to the British people. And that means that he can begin to make his case for Britain to remain within the EU from today.And that will have consequences. Tory ministers who want to support the campaign to leave the EU are champing at the bit, silenced by collective responsibility while the prime minister gets his campaign rolling.They will be released from their omerta once the cabinet has agreed the government's official position after the summit later this month.But that means the PM has a clear couple of weeks where he can own the political space - as long as his ministers behave.It also illustrates Mr Cameron's impatience for a quick referendum in June while his opponents are divided and before refugee numbers have reached their summer peak.So Mr Cameron insists that what he wants is the right deal not a quick deal.But today he gave every impression of being a man in a hurry, keen to start campaigning even while he's still negotiating.In other words, the referendum campaign has begun.",

But it's clear that the government is on the back foot, with even some of its own MPs expressing doubts about the proposals.One Conservative backbencher, who wished to remain anonymous, told our reporter, \"I'm not sure what the prime minister was thinking. This is a dog's breakfast of a deal. We're going to have to go back to the drawing board and start again.\"As the debate rages on, attention is turning to the upcoming parliamentary vote on the proposals. With Labour and the Liberal Democrats already pledging to oppose the deal, the government's majority is looking increasingly fragile.The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which has propped up the government since the last election, is also sounding uncertain, with its leader Arlene Foster warning that her party will not support a deal that \"undermines the integrity of the UK\".With the stakes higher than ever, the prime minister is facing a make-or-break moment."

You don't realise the tempo of it and playing in front of fans too. That helped me when I got my chance at Wolves. \"Iorfa could not have picked a more dramatic match in which to make his Wolves debut, a 2-1 home defeat by Bournemouth, in which Wolves lost following a controversial red card, later overturned, to Iorfa's team-mate Rajiv van La Parra. \"I'd been training with the first team all season and to actually make my debut without going on the bench first was a surprise. But the manager has shown great faith in me,\" he added.Since that defeat, Wolves have turned the corner, having not lost in the league since - and only on penalties in the FA Cup third-round replay with Fulham.And the son of a Nigerian international, also called Dominic Iorfa, is now glad he made the move from his native Essex. \"I was playing for Southend at 15 when Wolves saw me and offered me a trial,\" he said. \"My dad had played all over the world and he wanted me to sign here as he thought I'd have better opportunities. \"I like to get forward and I think I'm getting better at it.

President Trump, however, is not thought to be among them.Yet that didn't spare him a ribbing from Kimmel, or from being taken to task both obliquely and directly.Asghar Farhadi, the Iranian director of best foreign film The Salesman, stayed away in protest at the Trump administration's travel ban on immigrants.In his absence, a speech was read out that castigated the \"inhumane\" legislation for disrespecting his homeland and the six other countries it targeted.There were many moments to cherish at this year's Oscars - some humorous, some moving and some downright calamitous.Yet perhaps the most telling came when the stars of Hidden Figures arrived to announce the winner for best documentary feature.With them came Katherine Johnson, the 98-year-old African-American woman who was one of the real-life inspirations behind the space race drama.Could a woman born in 1918, who has lived through Jim Crow, segregation and the fight for civil rights, have ever dreamed of a day when her presence at the Oscars would generate a spontaneous standing ovation?La La Land may have won the most awards at this year's ceremony, but diversity was surely the biggest winner of all on Hollywood's glitziest night.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

        "text": "Indeed, the same portrait featured prominently on the front page of the New York Times in May without controversy. Rolling Stone is different because it's done so much over the decades to shape American popular and celebrity culture.To some, then, a bomb suspect is being depicted as a cultural icon. The sepia-tinted photograph, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev appears rather dreamy and vacant, looks like a relic from the 70s. Again, it has fuelled criticisms that the magazine is softening, even glamorising, his alleged crimes.This controversy also says a lot about the state of the American magazine market, and the pressure on publications to produce eye-catching and newsy images. This week Newsweek spliced together the portraits of the Florida teenager Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman, the man acquitted last weekend of his murder. Bloomberg's Businessweek depicted a hedge-fund manager with a graph coming from his groin that intentionally looked phallic. \"The cover story we are publishing this week falls within the traditions of journalism and Rolling Stone's long-standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day,\" it said.It added that many of its readers are in the same age group as the bombing suspect, and it was important for the publication to explore the issue.But two Massachusetts-based convenience store chains, Rockland and Tedeschi Food Shops, as well as Cumberland Farms, said on Wednesday they would not stock the edition.Two national pharmacy chains, CVS and Walgreens, quickly followed suit.Boston Mayor Thomas Menino said on Wednesday the Rolling Stone was \"ill-conceived, at best, and reaffirms a terrible message that destruction gains fame for killers and their 'causes'\".Boston City Council President Stephen Murphy said the cover was \"disgusting\". \"Rolling Stone has marketed Tsarnaev as a hero, a misunderstood teen, a product of two incompatible cultures,\" he said in a statement. \"He is not. He is a coward and a murderer who is appropriately facing the death penalty for his crimes. \"Commentators on social media networks also said the magazine cover was tasteless.Some likened the picture of the suspect, which he posted online himself, to an old Rolling Stone cover featuring Jim Morrison, lead singer of The Doors.More than 15,000 mainly outraged comments were posted on Rolling Stone's Facebook page.Boston punk band Dropkick Murphys, who recently donated $300,000 (\u00c2\u00a3197,000) to victims of the bombings, also expressed their anger. \"Rolling Stone you should be ashamed,\" the band tweeted. \"How about one of the courageous victims on your cover instead of this loser scum bag!\"",

Will the controversy lead to a re-examination of the role of media in shaping public opinion, or will it simply be seen as a one-off mistake? One thing is clear: the decision to feature Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on the cover of Rolling Stone has sparked a national conversation about the power and responsibility of the media.In related news, several retailers have announced that they will not be carrying the latest issue of Rolling Stone, citing customer complaints and concerns about the cover image. CVS Pharmacy, Walgreens, and Rite Aid are among the retailers that have announced they will not be selling the issue.Rolling Stone has yet to comment on the boycott, but the magazine's editors have reiterated their commitment to covering complex and controversial topics. \"We believe that our article is a thoughtful and deeply reported exploration of a complex issue,\" said a spokesperson for the magazine. \"We stand by our decision to publish it.\"",

The UK would be responsible for around 12% of that, producing a rough figure of \u20ac60bn (\u00a352bn).Former Finnish prime minister, Alex Stubb, who recently met Barnier, explained the thinking in Brussels to BBC Newsnight.Mr Stubb said: \"Basically what's going to happen is that Article 50 is triggered and a few key principles will be agreed - say the principles of finance or the principles for EU citizens and British citizens in Europe - the big things. And then at the same time in parallel you can start negotiations on a  future relationship. \"Mr Barnier is telling the UK that the main principle of the financial settlement is that the UK will have to honour the legal commitments it made as a full member of the EU.The key element will be the cohesion fund which is used to pay for infrastructure projects in deprived parts of the EU.This accounts for around a third of the EU budget which lasts until 31 December 2020. All cohesion funding has been agreed for the current seven year budget and the UK would be expected to honour the commitments it gave when the current seven year EU budget was agreed by David Cameron in 2013.The UK will not be responsible for its full share of the budget up until 2020 because the EU agrees on large parts of the seven year budget on an annual basis.Any commitments agreed once the UK has triggered Article 50 will not have to be funded by the UK.Mr Barnier will also table what are described as \"standing commitments\" in Brussels made by all member states.These cover two key areas:Nicholas Watt is political editor for BBC Newsnight",

Here's a man who sacrificed his life to save others. \"The auction in Devizes was one of the biggest involving Titanic memorabilia for many years.RMS Titanic had been four days into a week-long transatlantic crossing from Southampton to New York when the supposedly \"unsinkable\" ship struck an iceberg on 14 April 1912.The ship sank less than three hours later at about 02:20 on 15 April; 1,500 passengers and crew died and 710 survived.A collection of letters written by Chief Officer Henry Wilde, who was second in command on the vessel, fetched \u00a35,000 at the auction.In one of the letters, written onboard Titanic and posted at Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland, Wilde indicated he had misgivings about the new ship. \"I still don't like this ship... I have a queer feeling about it,\" he wrote.He had been expecting to take command of another ship, the Cymric, and only signed on to the Titanic on 9 April 1912, the day before it sailed.On 31 March 1912, he said he was \"awfully disappointed to find the arrangements for my taking command of the Cymric have altered. I am now going to join the Titanic until some other ship turns up for me\".After the collision, Wilde took charge of the even-numbered lifeboats, and oversaw their loading and lowering into the water. He was among those who died in the tragedy.Mr Aldridge said: \"It is without doubt one of the finest Titanic-related letters, written by one of the liner's most senior officers on Olympic stationery. \"This lot reveals previously unknown details and shows Wilde's obvious disappointment in being transferred to Titanic. \"What is certain is that he worked diligently to load the boats once the seriousness of the situation was clear to him. \"Also included in the sale was a postcard from the ship's senior wireless operator, 25-year-old Jack Phillips, from Farncombe in Surrey, who carried on sending distress messages to other ships as the Titanic sank.Phillips, who drowned, was described as \"the man who saved us all\" by survivor and fellow wireless operator Harold Bridge.The card, signed \"Love all, Jack\", describes the weather as the ship left Cowes on the Isle of Wight. It was sold for \u00a319,000.",

As a result, individuals have been buying up large quantities of baby milk in the UK and other countries, leading to shortages and frustration for parents. The UK's National Childbirth Trust (NCT) has expressed concern over the situation, saying that it is \"unacceptable\" that parents are struggling to access essential products for their babies. \"We understand that retailers are trying to prevent bulk buying, but we urge them to ensure that genuine customers are not unfairly penalized,\" said a spokesperson for the NCT.Meanwhile, online marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay have also been accused of facilitating the bulk buying and export of baby milk. A spokesperson for Amazon said that the company was \"working to prevent sellers from listing baby milk products in bulk\" and that it was \"monitoring the situation closely\".The UK government has also been drawn into the issue, with the Department of Health saying that it is \"aware of the concerns\" and is \"working with retailers and manufacturers to ensure that parents have access to the baby milk they need\".In the meantime, parents are being advised to check with their local retailers for availability of baby milk products and to consider alternative brands if necessary."

        "text": "\"The challenge is to explain the origin of the volatile elements like carbon that remain outside the core in the mantle portion of our planet,\" said Rajdeep Dasgupta, a co-author of the study from Rice University in Houston, Texas.According to a widely accepted idea called the Late Veneer Hypothesis, Earth formed from material that was largely devoid of volatiles. These elements, such as carbon, sulphur, nitrogen and hydrogen, were added later on by space rocks after Earth's core had finished forming. \"Any of those elements that fell to Earth in meteorites and comets more than about 100 million years after the Solar System formed could have avoided the intense heat of the magma ocean that covered Earth up to that point,\" said Yuan Li, from the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. \"The problem with that idea is that while it can account for the abundance of many of these elements, there are no known meteorites that would produce the ratio of volatile elements in the silicate portion of our planet. \"The group had previously published papers showing that if even if carbon had not vaporised into space when the planet was largely molten, it would have ended up in the metallic core of our planet - because the iron-rich alloys there have a strong affinity for carbon.But if this is the case, where did the carbon in the mantle and biosphere come from?The team used laboratory experiments that can recreate the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions that exist deep inside Earth and other rocky planets.The found that one scenario that could reconcile the discrepancies in the carbon-to-sulphur ratio and carbon abundance was an embryonic planet like Mercury colliding with and being absorbed by Earth, early in its history. \"Because it's a massive body, the dynamics could work in a way that the core of that planet would go directly to the core of our planet, and the carbon-rich mantle would mix with Earth's mantle,\" said Dr Dasgupta.",

She's the third British woman to win an individual gymnastics medal. Beth Tweddle was the first, with a bronze on the uneven bars in London 2012. The second was Bryony Page, who won trampoline silver in Rio last week.4. Amy's just missed out on the title of youngest ever British Olympic medal winner. That title's held by swimmer Sarah Hardcastle - she won a silver in the Los Angeles Olympics 32 years ago, aged 15 years, three months and 22 days. Amy won hers at 16 years, nine months and 20 days. (However, even Sarah Hardcastle seems pretty old compared to Team GB's youngest summer Olympian ever - Margery Hinton swam in the Paris Olympics 1924, aged 13 years and 43 days.)5. Amy says she first started doing gymnastics when she was just two years old.6. And the talent runs in the family - her mum was a gymnast too, and was her first coach.7. Her local gymnastics club in South Durham is known as the \"Pink Gym\", because everything in it is pink! And they're pretty proud of of Amy's achievement.8. She now trains for up to 31 hours every week, which is a lot to fit in alongside school work!9. Speaking of which... Amy only finished taking her GCSEs about a month before the Rio Olympics kicked off, and she'll find out her results when she gets back. Good luck, Amy!10. Her school gave her special permission to do her GCSEs over three years instead of two, so that she could fit in her training as well.11. Amy won her first national medal when she was just nine years old. She bagged a silver in the British Championships.12. She's been representing Britain in international competitions since she was 11.13. She's been crowned British floor champion for four years in a row.14. Her final score at Rio was 14.933 - just 1.033 below champion Simone Biles who won the gold with 15.966.15. Rio is Amy's first Olympics, and she wasn't expecting a medal. She told the BBC: \"I wasn't thinking about winning a medal. My coaches said I had nothing to lose and just to go out and enjoy it. I could hear a lot of cheers from the crowd and that helped me a lot.\"16. And this was her face after she'd heard she'd won bronze...Congratulations, Amy!",

I don't think there's any comparison\", she said during the news conference on Sunday, referring to the New York businessman's sex boast tape.Ms Broaddrick served as a volunteer on Mr Clinton's first gubernatorial campaign.The former president has denied the allegation through a lawyer and no charges were ever filed.She spoke out in 1999 during an investigation of Mr Clinton by the independent counsel Kenneth Starr, recanting sworn testimony a year earlier stating the incident never happened.Over the weekend, Mr Trump tweeted an interview Ms Broaddrick gave to right-wing website Breitbart, in which she alleged that Mrs Clinton thanked her for her silence at a political rally.The former White House aide alleged Mr Clinton groped her in his office in 1993, but had previously said it never happened.Ms Willey said she had met with the former president to ask for a paying job to help with her family's financial struggles.Mr Clinton has also denied this claim and the Office of Independent Counsel found her allegations inconclusive. \"I think we can bring peace to this world, and I think Donald Trump can lead us to that point,\" she said at the news conference.Ms Shelton was the 12-year-old victim in a sexual assault case Mrs Clinton was appointed to early in her legal profession.Mrs Clinton was the attorney for a factory worker accused of raping Ms Shelton, despite her objections over the case.In audio recordings from the mid-1980s of an interview Mrs Clinton had with an Arkansas reporter, the current Democratic nominee is heard laughing while discussing the trial, including this instance when she says: \"Of course he [the defendant] claimed he didn't [rape her]\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 He took a lie detector test. I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs. \"Ms Shelton's attacker ultimately admitted a reduced charge, and she has since said Mrs Clinton put \"me through hell\".",

        "first_sentence": "A study, based on millions of articles, charted deteriorating national sentiment ahead of the recent revolutions in Libya and Egypt.While the analysis was carried out retrospectively, scientists say the same processes could be used to anticipate upcoming conflict.The system also picked up early clues about Osama Bin Laden's location.Kalev Leetaru, from the University of Illinois' Institute for Computing in the Humanities, Arts and Social Science, presented his findings in the journal First Monday.The study's information was taken from a range of sources including the US government-run Open Source Centre and BBC Monitoring, both of which monitor local media output around the world.News outlets which published online versions were also analysed, as was the New York Times' archive, going back to 1945.In total, Mr Leetaru gathered more than 100 million articles.Reports were analysed for two main types of information: mood - whether the article represented good news or bad news, and location - where events were happening and the location of other participants in the story.Mood detection, or \"automated sentiment mining\" searched for words such as \"terrible\", \"horrific\" or \"nice\".Location, or \"geocoding\" took mentions of specific places, such as \"Cairo\" and converted them in to coordinates that could be plotted on a map.Analysis of story elements was used to create an interconnected web of 100 trillion relationships.Data was fed into an SGI Altix supercomputer, known as Nautilus, based at the University of Tennessee.The machine's 1024 Intel Nehalem cores have a total processing power of 8.2 teraflops (trillion floating point operations per second).Based on specific queries, Nautilus generated graphs for different countries which experienced the \"Arab Spring\".In each case, the aggregated results of thousands of news stories showed a notable dip in sentiment ahead of time  - both inside the country, and as reported from outside.For Egypt, the tone of media coverage in the month before President Hosni Mubarak's resignation had fallen to a low only seen twice before in the preceding 30 years.Previous dips coincided with the 1991 US aerial bombardment of Iraqi troops in Kuwait and the 2003 US invasion of Iraq.Mr Leetaru said that his system appeared to generate better intelligence than the US government was working with at the time.",
        "text": "\"The mere fact that the US President stood in support of Mubarak suggests very strongly that that even the highest level analysis suggested that Mubarak was going to stay there,\" he told BBC News. \"That is likely because you have these area experts who have been studying Egypt for 30 years, and in 30 years nothing has happened to Mubarak.The Egypt graph, said Mr Leetaru, suggested that something unprecedented was happening this time. \"If you look at this tonal curve it would tell you the world is darkening so fast and so strongly against him that it doesn't seem possible he could survive. \"Similar drops were seen ahead of the revolution in Libya and the Balkans conflicts of the 1990s.Saudi Arabia, which has thus far resisted a popular uprising, had experienced fluctuations, but not to the same extent as some other states where leaders were eventually overthrown.In his report, Mr Leetaru suggests that analysis of global media reports about Osama Bin Laden would have yielded important clues about his location.While many believed the al-Qaeda leader to be hiding in Afghanistan, geographic information extracted from media reports consistently identified him with Northern Pakistan.Only one report mentioned the town of Abbottabad prior to Bin Laden's discovery by US forces in April 2011.However, the geo-analysis narrowed him down to within 200km, said Mr Leetaru.The computer event analysis model appears to give forewarning of major events, based on deteriorating sentiment.However, in the case of this study, its analysis is applied to things that have already happened.According to Kalev Leetaru, such a system could easily be adapted to work in real time, giving an element of foresight. \"That's the next stage,\" said Mr Leetaru, who is already working on developing the technology. \"It looks like a stock ticker in many regards and you know what direction it has been heading the last few minutes and you want to know where it is heading in the next few. \"It is very similar to what economic forecasting algorithms do. \"Mr Leetaru said he also hoped to improve the resolution of analysis, especially in relation to geographic location. \"The next iteration is going to city level and beyond and looking at individual groups and how they interact. \"I liken it to weather forecasting.

She has had both knee joints replaced. She now has bladder cancer as well as the infection, which is causing immediate pain.In many ways, her situation sums up the story of the 21st Century NHS - coping with an ageing population with multiple conditions.Florence was taken to the ambulatory care centre at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.There was no bed for her immediately, so Kerry and Mark waited until the admission procedure was complete - another example of the delays affecting every ambulance service.The next morning, Florence was discharged from hospital and was recovering at home.There were, of course, many other cases covering all age groups, one woman in her 30s with previous heart problems feeling faint, another with a nine-month-old baby who was underweight and becoming dangerously dehydrated.But the rising caseload with older patients was all too clear.Cuts in social care funding in England contributing to delays in discharging medically fit patients from hospitals have been well documented.They in turn cause hold-ups for ambulances waiting to transfer patients into accident and emergency units.Add to that the apparent increase in the need for ambulance staff to help organise community health solutions for individual needs, and you add another pressure to an already stretched health system.",

It's heartbreaking, but it's also a reality check for our healthcare system.\"According to recent statistics, paramedics are attending to an increasing number of non-emergency calls, with many of these calls related to social care issues rather than medical emergencies. This shift in demand is putting a strain on ambulance services, which are already stretched to the limit.\"We're doing our best to respond to these calls, but it's clear that the system is broken,\" said Kerry, who has seen a significant increase in non-emergency calls over the past year. \"We need to find a way to address the root causes of these issues, rather than just patching up the symptoms.\"In Irene's case, Kerry and Mark were able to arrange for her to receive additional support from social services, including a home visit from a district nurse and a referral to a local befriending service. It was a small victory, but one that highlighted the need for a more comprehensive approach to caring for the elderly.As the paramedics left Irene's home, they couldn't help but wonder how many more patients like her were out there, struggling to access the care they needed. It was a sobering reminder of the challenges facing the healthcare system, and the critical role that paramedics like Kerry and Mark play in filling the gaps."

But even after eight years working at Loch Garten, the return of the ospreys still brings a lump to my throat. \"EJ has raised a total 23 chicks at Loch Garten, mainly with her regular partner, a male bird known as Odin.Many of her chicks have successfully fledged.But sadly, in 2008 and then in 2009, a young male and a young female she reared died after migrating from Scotland.The male called Deshar died after he made what the RSPB described as a \"navigational error\" and he missed landfall in the Azores and carried on out to sea.His sister, Nethy, died the following the year in Africa.Shortly after laying eggs six years ago, EJ was forced to defend her nest against a rival female.Reserve staff monitoring CCTV images watched anxiously as the eggs rolled around the nest as the pair scuffled.EJ eventually managed to fight off the other bird, but during the same season feathers flew again when she had to ward off a kestrel, a pair of crossbill and a redstart interested in using her nest.Before Odin, EJ's long-term mate was Henry.But in 2009, staff at the reserve became concerned about VS, an older rogue male with a record for disrupting breeding seasons.In that season of seven years ago, EJ returned to Loch Garten before Henry and mated with VS.When Henry arrived he knew the eggs in the nest were not his and kicked them out, destroying the eggs.Complex relationships have been a hallmark of the breeding seasons at Highlands reserve,Back in 2007, EJ incubated two separate clutches to rival males but they all perished.And there were similar problems last year.Jess Tomes, of RSPB Scotland, said: \"Last year was like something out of a soap opera at Loch Garten. \"Both EJ and Odin were present but we had an interloping male osprey visiting the nest attempting to ingratiate himself with EJ while Odin was away on hunting trips. \"The rival male actually kicked Odin and EJ's eggs from the nest! In the end things got so torrid that the birds failed to raise a family for the first time in years. \"She added: \"This year we are hoping for plainer sailing and a happy osprey family. \"With EJ back home our thoughts are turning to Odin.

Mr Rouhani, 68, signed a nuclear deal between Iran, the US and other countries in 2015.International sanctions were lifted as a result, but average Iranians say they do not feel the economic benefits in their daily lives.While oil exports have rebounded and inflation is back at single-digits, unemployment remains high, especially among the young people.Iran's hardliners had pulled all the stops and mobilised all their resources to bring out as many people as possible to grab the last centre of power in Iran that was not under their control, namely the executive branch.Sensing an effort by the hardliners, supporters of President Rouhani who back his promises to steer the country toward moderation came out in big numbers too. Turnout has been unprecedented. In Tehran, five million people turned out to vote - twice as many as in 2013.This was a revenge of the people against the hardliners who intimidated them, jailed them, executed them, drove them to exile, pushed them out of their jobs, and discriminated against women.President Rouhani will now have a bigger mandate to push through his reforms, to put an end to extremism, to build bridges with the outside world, to put the economy back on track.Iranians have said a resounding Yes to President Rouhani who, in recent years and particularly during the last several weeks of campaigning, promised to expand individual and political freedoms and make all those centres of power, like the Revolutionary Guard, accountable.He also promised a moderate vision and an outward-looking Iran and, at rallies, openly attacked the conservative-dominated judiciary and security services.Another challenge, experts say, will come from abroad, and the relations with the new US government.

The fire in the mine is at dangerous levels and it could blow at any time and that's what they are worried about. \"The one plus from this is that there were no men trapped in the mine by the fire, and you don't want to put anyone else at risk. \"Nuneaton MP Marcus Jones called for the colliery to be mothballed rather than completely closed.The Conservative MP said: \"There is still a vast amount of coal down there and there is always the possibility that it could be mined again in the future. \"Chris Kitchen, of the National Union of Mineworkers, said the news was \"devastating\" for the men who relied on the colliery and their families.He said: \"We tend to find many of our members who work in the mining industry have known nothing else. \"He said union officials were now determined to get the workers the redundancy settlements \"they deserve\".Andrew Mackintosh from UK Coal said that it is the company's \"aim\" to give the workers their full redundancy pay and that discussions are under way.He said: \"We've got redeployment under way we've moved probably about 50-100 people, but unfortunately for the vast majority, we just won't be able to deploy everybody.\"",

The ruling is important in that it sends a clear signal that the use of detention should be used less and, as stated, as a last resort. \"The IOM said it was legitimate to detain migrants in cases where they risked absconding, but the 18-month period \"is a maximum\".The ruling does not apply to the UK or Ireland, which are not within the Schengen zone. It also does not apply to Denmark, which although a member of the Schengen zone holds an opt out from European Union justice policies.The ruling also contains some important conditions.It says migrants may be detained - for up to 18 months - if there is \"a risk of the removal being compromised\", which may be interpreted to mean that they are a flight risk.Detention is also permitted if a person is subject to a deportation order and has refused to go, or if they have already been deported, and have attempted to re-enter the country illegally, in breach of an entry ban.",

        "text": "It is hardly surprising a potential Brexit would not be its cup of tea.It actually cited two reasons for the currency's weakness, saying between August 2015 and February 2016 \"the British pound depreciated by 7%, driven by expectations of a later normalisation of monetary policy in the United Kingdom and concerns about a potential exit from the European Union\".The point about the \"later normalisation of monetary policy\" means as a result of the general weakness of the economy, the expected date of the first rise in interest rates from the Bank of England was delayed.The IMF is presumably comparing the pound with a selection of currencies. Between the beginning of August and the end of February, the pound actually fell about 11% against the US dollar and 10% against the euro.How much of this was due to the referendum and how much was down to other factors?Well, the referendum date was not confirmed until 20 February, but it was widely expected to be announced.There was a pretty sharp fall in the value of the pound around the time of the announcement, as you can see from the graphs, although that particular dip was relatively short-lived.So, how much of the pound's fall was down to uncertainty surrounding a potential Brexit as opposed to factors such as interest rate expectations?As we have discussed before, predicting uncertainty cannot be seen as a controversial forecast, and it is generally accepted markets do not like uncertainty.So it is fair to say some of the fall in the pound has been due to the potential for Brexit - it is a factor that has been cited regularly in analysts' reports. The Office for Budget Responsibility cited some of the banks predicting weakness for the pound.But given the result of the referendum will have implications for the economy for decades to come, a bit of weakness in the pound ahead of the vote should not be seen as too worrying a factor.In particular, a weak pound is not a bad thing for everyone - it is good news for many exporters in the UK.Reality Check verdict: The referendum debate is likely to be one of the factors weakening the pound, but things like delayed interest rate rises are also responsible.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate",

In recent weeks, he has faced backlash for using a beach closed to the public during a government shutdown, and for his response to a series of protests and demonstrations in New Jersey.Despite the criticism, Christie remains a prominent figure in Republican politics, and has been mentioned as a potential candidate for various offices in the future. However, incidents like the one on Sunday are likely to continue to fuel concerns about his temperament and ability to connect with ordinary voters."

There's talk of him playing on 30 January. \"British and Irish Lions chief executive John Feehan has said Gatland is the leading contender to take charge again when they tour New Zealand in 2017.Gatland guided the 2013 Lions to a 2-1 series win over Australia and the Welsh Rugby Union would again back Gatland for the Lions role.However, the Wales boss played down the prospect, saying: \"I haven't had any conversations with anyone about that. I am only reading things in the media. \"If you have a good Six Nations and a good summer tour [to New Zealand], then you are in contention. \"That is something I will think about later down the line.\"",

They are seeking to have the case dismissed on the grounds that the prosecution is violating the agreement made over a decade ago.The email has sparked controversy, with some legal experts questioning whether a prosecutor has the authority to grant immunity without the knowledge and consent of the victim. Others have raised concerns about the potential impact on the case, which has already been delayed several times.Andrea Constand, the victim in the 2005 civil case, has not commented on the email or the immunity claim. However, her lawyer has stated that she is committed to seeing justice served and will continue to cooperate with the prosecution.The case against Cosby has sparked widespread outrage and debate, with many calling for accountability for the alleged crimes. The comedian's legal team has maintained that the allegations are false and that Cosby is the victim of a conspiracy.The judge in the case has scheduled a hearing to consider Cosby's motion to dismiss the charges. The outcome of the hearing could have significant implications for the case and for the broader conversation about sexual assault and accountability.In the meantime, the email has raised new questions about the handling of the case and the role of prosecutors in negotiating deals with defendants. As the legal battle continues, one thing is clear: the case against Bill Cosby is far from over."

If they can take a picture, great, if not then just put the data in the app afterwards. \"Chris Shepherd, South-East Asia regional director of Traffic, said there had been an \"unparalleled spike in illegal wildlife trade\".He observed: \"Sadly, animals are being illegally killed or taken from the wild around the world to be sold for traditional medicines, luxury food, horns or other parts, restaurant dishes, fashion items or pets. \"Dr Shepherd explained how people could help using the app: \"We want people to be the eyes and ears in the fight against the illegal wildlife trade.\"",

He has since become an advocate for clean sport and has spoken publicly about the dangers of performance-enhancing drugs.When asked about the specific allegations, Mr. McMaster refused to name the athletes involved, citing concerns for their privacy and the potential consequences of outing them. However, he did suggest that the problem of doping in Scottish sport is more widespread than previously thought.\"I'm not saying it's rampant, but it's certainly more prevalent than people think,\" he said. \"And it's not just limited to rugby and football. I've heard stories about athletes in other sports who have used performance-enhancing drugs to get ahead.\"The Scottish Rugby Union and the Scottish Football Association have both released statements denying any knowledge of doping among their athletes. The SRU said it takes a \"zero-tolerance approach\" to doping and has a robust testing program in place to detect and prevent drug use.The SFA echoed these sentiments, saying it is \"committed to ensuring that Scottish football is free from doping\" and that it works closely with UK Anti-Doping to educate players and coaches about the dangers of performance-enhancing drugs.However, Mr. McMaster's allegations have sparked calls for a wider investigation into doping in Scottish sport.

What's more, the likelihood of a school-leaver ending up at university, college, training or work is still far too dependent on their background. \"No real improvement has been made on that front either, and the SNP is running out of excuses about why that is. \"Scottish Labour has also criticised the government over the figures, saying they were a \"black mark\" against the SNP's record on education.Iain Gray, Scottish Labour's education spokesman, said: \"Nicola Sturgeon promised to make education her top priority. Instead the gap between the richest and the poorest has grown as opportunities for school leavers are closed off. \"Young people, especially those from the poorest backgrounds, are being failed by an SNP government which has made a mess of education policy in Scotland. \"John Swinney took over an education brief with a stacked inbox - and he has done nothing to show he is capable of addressing the scale of the problems. \"Other statistics from the report show that in the most deprived areas, 42.7% of those leaving school in 2015-16 had a minimum qualification of one Higher, up by 1.5 points from 41.2% the previous year.However, in the most affluent parts of the country 81.2% of school leavers in 2015-16 had one Higher or more, a rise of 0.9 points from 2014-15.Almost two-fifths (37.3%) of youngsters who finished school in 2015-16 went on to higher education, at either college or university, while 22.4% went on to further education college and more than a quarter (28.7%) found work.Overall, the number of school leavers with at least one Higher increased to 61.7% - up from 60.2% in 2014-15 and compared with 55.7% in 2012-13.Mr Swinney said: \"It is encouraging to see the number of young people attaining qualifications at Higher level or above increasing - and I am particularly pleased to see a notable improvement in the proportion of young people who are looked-after and care-experienced gaining a qualification. \"While this is a step in the right direction, there is still more to do to close the gap between our most and least vulnerable children, and raise attainment for all. \"That is what the reforms I announced last week are designed to do. \"By giving more power to schools, including more direct control over budgets, we will empower schools to target resources where they are needed the most to improve the life chances of all of our children and young people.\"",

Dr. Louise Hayward, a leading education expert at the University of Glasgow, said: \"The attainment gap is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach.

However, critics argue that more needs to be done to address the underlying issues driving the attainment gap.As the debate continues, one thing is clear: the future of Scotland's young people hangs in the balance. With the attainment gap remaining a significant challenge, it's imperative that policymakers, educators, and stakeholders work together to find solutions that will give all young people in Scotland the opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances.In the coming weeks and months, the Scottish Government will face intense scrutiny over its handling of education, and it remains to be seen whether the reforms announced last week will be enough to address the concerns of critics and stakeholders.

It's a double-edged sword. \"In May, the American Civil Liberties Union in Southern California sent letters asking federal and state civil rights agencies to investigate the systemic failure to hire women directors at all levels of the film and television industry.In October, it was reported that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the US had begun contacting female directors to investigate gender discrimination in Hollywood.The gender gap in Hollywood pay also took centre stage last year after Jennifer Lawrence wrote an essay about unequal pay.Lauzen's report also showed films with women in the directing chair opened the door to women in other roles behind the scenes.Films that had at least one female director (including assistant directors), employed more women as writers, editors, and cinematographers than films with exclusively male directors.On films with at least one woman director, women made up 53% of writers compared to 10% if the directors were exclusively men.In a similar comparison, women comprised 32% of editors, compared to 19% if the directors were male.Historically, the report showed that while the percentage of directors has remained the same since 1998, the percentages of executive producers, producers, editors, and cinematographers have increased.However, in the same time the percentage of women writers has declined from 13% to 11%.The report showed that in 2015 women fared best in Hollywood as producers - making up 26% of posts.

But expenditure has not kept up with a growing state prison population, which saw a rise of 343% between 1980 and 2013, although it has now declined slightly.Mr Gibson-Light said staff and inmates at the prison he visited said the amount of food being provided had decreased steadily over decades and warned the shift could have serious implications. \"Prisoners are so unhappy with the quality and quantity of prison food that they receive that they have begun relying on ramen noodles - a cheap, durable food product - as a form of money in the underground economy,\" he said. \"The form of money is not something that changes often or easily, even in the prison underground economy; it takes a major issue or shock to initiate such a change,\" he added.He called for more research into what the reduction in food could mean for the care of prisoners.",

        "text": "However, parents will not need to replace car seats they have already bought because they can continue to use them.From next year, changes are being made on the rules regarding backless booster seats.Currently, parents can use these types of seats for children who weigh 15kg (2st 5lbs) and above - typically aged three and over.The new rules will mean only children weighing over 22kg (3st 7lbs) who are also over 125cm (4ft 1ins) tall can use the seats.The United Nations, which sets the safety standards for car seats, has approved the change which must now be implemented by the EU.The government said the earliest the new rules will come in is March 2017 and they will affect the whole of the UK.Many child car seat experts say they are unsuitable for small children as the child is not held as securely in the seat, the adult seatbelt is not guided across their body in the best way and they offer little protection if a car is involved in a side-on crash.Do not worry. The changes will only apply to new backless seats and not ones already on the market that meet current safety standards.Parents can continue to use their current model after the rule change and will not need to buy a new one.It will be down to manufacturers of new seats to ensure they meet the revised safety standards and are labelled correctly.Children must use a child car seat until they are 12 years old or 135cm (4ft 5in) tall, whichever comes first.There are typically three types of children's car seats:Only EU-approved child car seats can be used in the UK - which have a label showing a capital \"E\" in a circle.Parents should typically choose a car seat based on their child's height or weight.A driver can be fined up to \u00c2\u00a3500 if a child under 14 does not wear a seat belt or child restraint. Anyone 14 and over not wearing a seat belt must pay the fine themselves.There are exceptions. For example, children can travel without a child car seat in a taxi or minicab if they travel on a rear seat and wear an adult seat belt if they are aged three or older or without a seat belt if they are under three.Many parents think they can judge which car seat they need to buy based on their child's age but it should only be used as guidance.Car seats are typically categorised according to height and weight.Height-based car seats, known as \"i-Size\" seats, must be rear-facing until the child is over 15 months old.For weight-based car seats, the type depends on how heavy a child is.A more detailed list is available through childcarseats.org.uk",

The report says many poor households in these countries have also been hit by higher prices of imported goods, resulting from sharp declines in national currencies.The report warns: \"Even the limited gains in poverty reduction made over the past decade could rapidly reverse. \"It's worth adding that the growth figures for the world and for groups of countries reported by the bank should not be directly compared with the figures given by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).That's because there are two ways of adding up country figures, and the two agencies choose to highlight different ones.But comparable figures are there to be found.

The victims, who were all under the age of 16 at the time of the assaults, came forward to report the incidents to the police in 2020.During the trial, the court heard that the defendant had used his position of trust to groom and exploit his victims, subjecting them to repeated sexual assaults over a period of several years. The victims described the defendant's actions as \"calculated and manipulative,\" and said that they had suffered severe emotional trauma as a result of the abuse.The judge, in handing down the sentence, described the defendant's actions as \"appalling\" and said that he had shown a \"callous disregard\" for the well-being of his victims. The judge also praised the bravery of the victims, who had come forward to report the abuse despite the trauma it had caused them.The defendant will be required to serve at least 10 years of his sentence before he is eligible for parole. He will also be placed on the sex offenders' register for life.The police have praised the victims for their courage in coming forward and have urged anyone else who may have been a victim of the defendant's abuse to contact them.

Many have called for stricter vetting procedures and more robust safeguarding measures to be put in place to prevent similar cases of abuse from occurring in the future.\"This case is a wake-up call for all of us,\" said Dr. Emma Taylor, a leading expert on child protection. \"We need to take a hard look at our institutions and ensure that they are doing everything in their power to protect children from abuse. This includes implementing robust safeguarding measures, conducting regular background checks, and providing training for staff on how to identify and report signs of abuse.\"The defendant's sentence has been welcomed by many in the community, who see it as a step towards justice for the victims. However, others have expressed concern that the sentence is not long enough, given the severity of the crimes committed.\"While 10 years is a significant sentence, it's hard to see how it can truly reflect the harm and suffering that the defendant has caused,\" said one local resident. \"These victims will have to live with the trauma of what happened to them for the rest of their lives. The defendant should be behind bars for a lot longer than 10 years.\"As the community continues to grapple with the aftermath of the case, one thing is clear: the need for greater action to prevent child sexual abuse and support survivors is more pressing than ever.",

The victims, who were all under the age of 16 at the time of the assaults, came forward to report the incidents to the police in 2020.During the trial, the court heard that the defendant had used his position of trust to groom and exploit his victims, subjecting them to repeated sexual assaults over a period of several years. The victims described the defendant's actions as \"calculated and manipulative,\" and said that they had suffered severe emotional trauma as a result of the abuse.The judge, in handing down the sentence, described the defendant's actions as \"appalling\" and said that he had shown a \"callous disregard\" for the well-being of his victims. The judge also praised the bravery of the victims, who had come forward to report the abuse despite the trauma it had caused them.The defendant will be required to serve at least 10 years of his sentence before he is eligible for parole. He will also be placed on the sex offenders' register for life.The police have praised the victims for their courage in coming forward and have urged anyone else who may have been a victim of the defendant's abuse to contact them.

There were pent-up emotions to be released, and the quality of the game suffered from the raucous surroundings.There was excitement and zeal as the two sets of players hared around the Ibrox pitch, but not enough self-control to bring some poise to the proceedings.Rangers had the most cause to rue that lack of restraint, since they should have opened the scoring when Dean Shiels was sent through on goal. The forward hurried his finish, though, and scuffed the ball wide.It became a galling miss for Rangers, because minutes later a hopeful Gavin Gunning header sent Armstrong clear.Nadir Ciftci was returning from an offside position but was deemed not to be interfering with play and Armstrong took advantage of the confusion to clip a shot past Simonsen that kissed a post before nestling in the net.A pattern was established, since Rangers had the better patches of play, but could not influence the outcome.When Fraser Aird was free in the area, he laid the ball back to Jon Daly, only for the striker to direct a shot rashly over the bar.Moments later, Richard Foster failed to clear his lines and allowed Ryan Gauld to burrow into the Rangers penalty area before shunting into the path of Armstrong. He could not connect cleanly and neither, subsequently, could Mackay-Steven, but the ball looped off Bilel Mohsni, over Simonsen, and into the net.Smith restored some hope for Rangers with a free-kick that squeezed between Radoslaw Cierzniak and the base of his left-hand post.That goal came just before half-time and, athough Rangers continued to enjoy greater possession after the interval, their frailties could not be disguised.Mohsni was often hapless in possession, attacks were intermittent and haphazard in nature, and there was not enough link-up play between the midfield and the forwards.United's midfield struggled to retain possession, and their defence often sat too deep, but their four front players were a constant threat, not least because of the calamities that the Rangers defence were capable of.When Foster broke up one move and passed back to Simonsen, the goalkeeper hesitated before stubbing the ball straight at Ciftci. The striker rounded the stricken goalkeeper and was celebrating even before he rolled the ball into the empty net.Rangers restored something of their reputation with this display, but United were the more clinical side.",

        "text": "With a heavy heart he abandoned the forces, shelved his accountancy plans and began to ply his trade as a cricketer.Graveney scored more than 1,500 runs in his second and third seasons with the county and was handed a Test debut against South Africa at Old Trafford in 1951.He scored 175 against India in his second Test but only mustered one further hundred in the following six years as his inconsistent form saw him frequently left out of the side.Graveney played some of his finest cricket after joining Worcestershire in 1961, becoming the first player since World War II to reach a century of centuries in 1964 when he scurried a single off Northamptonshire's David Larter following an uncharacteristically mistimed pull shot.His prolific form for the county prompted an England recall in the summer of 1966, which he fully justified with 459 runs at 76.50 in four Tests against the touring West Indians.Graveney's international career ended on a sour note when he was suspended for three Tests as punishment for playing a benefit game on the rest day of the first Test against the Windies in 1969, and was never picked again.He retired from county cricket in 1970 but spent two further seasons playing and coaching Queensland in Australian first-class cricket.Graveney became a pub landlord in retirement, worked as a cricket pundit for BBC television and continued to play golf off a handicap of one.He was president of the MCC from 2004-2005 and four years later was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. At the time of his death he was one of only 25 men in the history of cricket to reach a hundred hundreds.Graveney's nephew David followed his father and uncle in captaining Gloucestershire, and was England's chairman of selectors during their 2005 Ashes success.",

The residents around him all were supporting the security forces.My colleagues and I then walked closer towards the frontline. We were less than 200m from the encampment. Thick trails of black smoke stopped us from getting a look at what was happening around the mosque. But the wind sometimes blew over the sound of a man's voice on loudspeaker from the mosque area. The words were too difficult to make out.We then decided to leave. As we drove away, two police officers ran towards our vehicle, cocking their pistols to make us stop. They had orders to confiscate camera footage.They let us go, and we made our way past an outer cordon run by the military and into the centre of Cairo.No-one had known the exact timing of the security forces's operation.

The company's shares have taken a hit as a result, falling by over 20% in the past 12 months.Mr. Packer's potential bid to take Crown private has been the subject of much speculation in recent weeks. With his significant stake in the company, he would need to secure funding to acquire the remaining shares, a move that could be costly and complex.Industry insiders suggest that Mr. Packer may be looking to restructure the company and reduce its debt, which has been a major concern for investors. Taking the company private could also give him more flexibility to make strategic decisions without having to answer to shareholders.However, any potential bid would need to be approved by regulators and would likely face scrutiny from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). The company's board would also need to consider any offer and make a recommendation to shareholders.In a statement, Crown said that Mr. Packer's resignation from the board was effective immediately, and that he would no longer have any role in the company's operations.

The company's shares have taken a hit as a result, falling by over 20% in the past 12 months.Mr. Packer's potential bid to take Crown private has been the subject of much speculation in recent weeks. With his significant stake in the company, he would need to secure funding to acquire the remaining shares, a move that could be costly and complex.Industry insiders suggest that Mr. Packer may be looking to restructure the company and reduce its debt, which has been a major concern for investors. Taking the company private could also give him more flexibility to make strategic decisions without having to answer to shareholders.However, any potential bid would need to be approved by regulators and would likely face scrutiny from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). The company's board would also need to consider any offer and make a recommendation to shareholders.In a statement, Crown said that Mr. Packer's resignation from the board was effective immediately, and that he would no longer have any role in the company's operations. The company's shares were trading flat in early morning trade, as investors digested the news and awaited further developments.The move is the latest in a series of high-profile departures from Crown's board and management team, and has raised questions about the company's future direction and strategy."

Morrisons' sales fell 3.3% compared with the same period last year, and its market share was 11.1%, down from 11.5%.Tesco recorded the worst sales slide, down 3.7%, with a 1.1 percentage point fall in market share to 28.7%.In contrast, Aldi sales have jumped by more than 25% from a year earlier - slightly less stellar than the 32% growth recorded in the 12 weeks to 20 July.

        "text": "\"\"Having watched the programme my firm conclusion was that these zoos are no longer relevant,\" he told the BBC. \"They are relics of the past, and the arguments to justify keeping animals in captivity no longer stand up. \"Mr Francis argued that most animals kept in zoos were not endangered and that there had been few examples of endangered species being reintroduced to the wild after being kept or bred in captivity.Most of the zoos involved in the firm's decision are in southeast Asia and none are in the UK.The travel company markets about 3,500 tours from 350 operators in the UK and abroad.It stopped offering tours involving elephant rides about 18 months ago.It will still sell holidays that include trips to rescue centres, animal rehabilitation centres and breeding centres for endangered species.Mr Francis explained that it had taken two staff six months to research the zoos and other destinations being offered in his clients' holidays.Identifying the zoos had taken just a couple of weeks, but scrutinising the other animal facilities on offer to travellers had taken much longer.The decision to weed out trips to traditional zoos was welcomed by a wildlife charity, the Born Free Foundation. \"[Our] investigations have, over the years, demonstrated that few animal species can adapt to a lifetime in captivity, with many individual animals developing abnormal behaviour, not seen in their wild counterparts, in order to cope with captivity's restrictive and often barren environments,\" said the president of Born Free, Will Travers. \"A global shift in public consciousness, a movement, may see - if not an end - a massive reduction in the exploitation of wild animals in their millions in thousands of zoos worldwide,\" he added.Mr Francis said none of the tour operators whose holidays had been dropped had objected to his decision. \"They told us they hadn't thought things through but now they have been presented with the evidence they agree\", he said.",

But the left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) with 11% found itself in the position of kingmaker and refused to give its votes to the ANC.Analysis: Milton Nkosi, BBC Africa, JohannesburgThe election of the Democratic Alliance's Herman Mashaba as mayor of Johannesburg represents a tectonic shift in South African politics.This is the first time since the end of apartheid that the ANC lost control of the city of gold, as Johannesburg is known locally.The Johannesburg wing of the ANC is known within the party to be professional and not corrupt.However, voters still punished it for the litany of corruption scandals the ANC has been involved in at a national level.And there were some local problems, including potholed roads, a shambolic electricity billing system and refuse strikes that left the city filthy.What has happened in Johannesburg is a microcosm of what could happen nationally come the general election in 2019.Mr Mashaba, a 56-year-old businessman, has promised to reform the city administration. \"As of this evening, corruption is declared public enemy number one in this city,\" he told cheering supporters. \"Public monies that have been misspent, misused, over the last five, 10 years or so ... we're going to take this money, we're going to look after it, so that we can provide basic services to our people. \"Mr Mashaba also pledged to tackle unemployment. \"Over 800,000 of our residents, one-in-three, are today unemployed.

His campaign promises to root out corruption and improve service delivery resonated with voters, many of whom have grown disillusioned with the ANC's governance over the years.The ANC, which has dominated South African politics since the country's transition to democracy, has faced criticism for its handling of the economy, high levels of unemployment, and allegations of corruption. The party's loss in Johannesburg is seen as a significant blow to its national leadership, which has been struggling to maintain its grip on power.The DA, which has traditionally been seen as a party of the white minority, has made significant inroads in recent years, attracting support from black South Africans who are disillusioned with the ANC's governance. Mashaba's election is seen as a major breakthrough for the party, which has been seeking to expand its influence beyond its traditional strongholds.The new mayor has pledged to work with all parties to address the city's challenges, including improving public transportation, increasing access to housing and basic services, and promoting economic growth. His election is seen as a fresh start for Johannesburg, which has been plagued by corruption and mismanagement in recent years.As Mashaba takes office, he faces significant challenges, including a city budget deficit and a backlog of service delivery issues. However, his election has sparked hope among Johannesburg residents, who are eager for change and a new direction for their city.",

The party's leader, Mmusi Maimane, hailed Mashaba's election as a \"historic moment\" for the DA and a \"new dawn\" for Johannesburg.\"This election is a clear rejection of the ANC's corrupt and incompetent governance,\" Maimane said in a statement. \"The people of Johannesburg have spoken loudly and clearly, and they have chosen a new path forward. We are committed to working tirelessly to deliver on our promises and to restore the city to its former glory.\"Mashaba's election has also sparked interest from international investors, who see the change in leadership as an opportunity to invest in Johannesburg's economy. The city is a key hub for business and trade in Africa, and Mashaba's commitment to rooting out corruption and improving service delivery is seen as a positive step towards attracting new investment.However, Mashaba's task will not be easy. The city faces significant challenges, including a budget deficit of over R10 billion and a backlog of service delivery issues, including inadequate housing, poor sanitation, and unreliable public transportation.

His success or failure will have significant implications for the future of South African politics and the economy. But for now, Johannesburg residents are celebrating a new era of leadership and a fresh start for their city.",
        "final_sample_text": "The election of Herman Mashaba, a successful businessman and DA mayoral candidate, signals a significant change in the political landscape of Johannesburg, South Africa's largest city and economic hub.Mashaba, who won the election with a narrow margin of 52% of the vote, has vowed to tackle the city's pressing issues, including corruption, poverty, and inequality. His campaign promises to root out corruption and improve service delivery resonated with voters, many of whom have grown disillusioned with the ANC's governance over the years.The ANC, which has dominated South African politics since the country's transition to democracy, has faced criticism for its handling of the economy, high levels of unemployment, and allegations of corruption. The party's loss in Johannesburg is seen as a significant blow to its national leadership, which has been struggling to maintain its grip on power.The DA, which has traditionally been seen as a party of the white minority, has made significant inroads in recent years, attracting support from black South Africans who are disillusioned with the ANC's governance. Mashaba's election is seen as a major breakthrough for the party, which has been seeking to expand its influence beyond its traditional strongholds.The new mayor has pledged to work with all parties to address the city's challenges, including improving public transportation, increasing access to housing and basic services, and promoting economic growth. His election is seen as a fresh start for Johannesburg, which has been plagued by corruption and mismanagement in recent years.As Mashaba takes office, he faces significant challenges, including a city budget deficit and a backlog of service delivery issues. However, his election has sparked hope among Johannesburg residents, who are eager for change and a new direction for their city. Mashaba's victory is also seen as a significant shift in the political landscape of South Africa, as it marks the first time that the DA has won control of a major metropolitan municipality in the country. The party's leader, Mmusi Maimane, hailed Mashaba's election as a \"historic moment\" for the DA and a \"new dawn\" for Johannesburg.\"This election is a clear rejection of the ANC's corrupt and incompetent governance,\" Maimane said in a statement. \"The people of Johannesburg have spoken loudly and clearly, and they have chosen a new path forward. We are committed to working tirelessly to deliver on our promises and to restore the city to its former glory.\"Mashaba's election has also sparked interest from international investors, who see the change in leadership as an opportunity to invest in Johannesburg's economy."

However, critics argue that the move is a thinly veiled attempt to prevent the Kurds from gaining control of a strategic region in northern Syria.The Kurdish forces, who have been backed by the US-led coalition in their fight against IS, have accused Turkey of targeting them in an effort to undermine their gains against the extremist group.As the situation continues to escalate, there are growing concerns over the potential for a wider conflict in the region. The Syrian government has warned that it will take all necessary measures to defend its sovereignty, while the Turkish government has vowed to continue its military operations until the Kurdish forces are pushed back.The international community is urging restraint on all sides, but the situation remains highly volatile and the risk of further violence remains high. The United States, a key ally of Turkey, has called for a ceasefire and urged Turkey to exercise restraint, but has stopped short of condemning the military operation. The European Union, meanwhile, has expressed \"grave concern\" over the situation and has called for an immediate end to the violence.As the situation continues to deteriorate, humanitarian organizations are warning of a potential catastrophe. The UN has reported that thousands of civilians are trapped in the conflict zone, with many more displaced by the fighting. Aid agencies are struggling to reach those in need, with many roads and borders closed due to the violence.The Kurdish Red Crescent has reported that at least 20 civilians have been killed and dozens more injured in the past 24 hours, with many more feared dead. The organization has also warned of a potential humanitarian crisis, with many families forced to flee their homes without access to basic necessities like food, water, and shelter.The Turkish government has denied allegations that its military operation is targeting civilians, and has instead blamed the Kurdish forces for using civilians as human shields. However, human rights groups have disputed this claim, saying that there is evidence of Turkish forces targeting civilian areas and infrastructure.As the international community struggles to respond to the crisis, there are growing concerns over the potential for a wider conflict in the region."

        "text": "UN refugee body UNHCR has also expressed concern about the fairness of on-water screening of asylum claims.Australian officials have not revealed where the group were being held.Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said on Friday that - following talks with Indian officials - they would be brought to Australia.Consular officials from the Indian High Commission would be given access to determine identities and \"arrange where possible the return of any persons to India\".India would also consider taking non-nationals who were Indian residents, he said.It was not clear what might happen to those who did not fall into this category, nor was the extent to which asylum claims would be assessed addressed.But Mr Morrison said no members of the group would be allowed to settle in Australia.He declined to comment on where the group would be detained but local reports say they are being transferred to the Curtin detention centre via the Cocos Islands.The move is an apparent set-back for the government, which enforces tough policies aimed at ending the arrival of asylum boats.Australia detains all those who arrive by boat. In recent months detainees have been processed offshore, in camps in Papua New Guinea and Nauru. Those found to be refugees will be settled in PNG and Nauru, not Australia.Reports have also emerged in recent months of Australia towing boats back to Indonesia, the most common embarkation point.The government says the aim is to save lives by preventing people getting on dangerous boats. But refugee advocates and the UN have voiced increasing concern about the policies, with severe criticism of conditions in Australia's detention camps.Responding to Mr Morrison's announcement, Amnesty International said the development showed that \"stranding a boatload of people in the middle of the sea, in an effort to 'stop the boats', has achieved nothing\". \"All it has done is prolong and exacerbate the suffering of more than 150 asylum seekers and their families,\" said Graeme McGregor, the group's refugee campaign co-ordinator.All asylum seekers must have the opportunity to undergo a \"full, fair and rigorous\" assessment for refugee status, he said.",

        "text": "\"We are continuing to move rapidly to adapt and rebalance BP for the changing environment,\" he added.Oil prices have been hit by the slowing global economy, the strong US dollar and oversupply.BP's dividend will remain unchanged at 10 cents a share for the quarter.Sanjiv Shah, chief investment officer at Sun Global Investments, said: \"The short term looks difficult but shareholders should be encouraged by the fact that a pick-up in prices is expected soon and that BP management are committed to continue paying out current dividend levels. \"Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, economics editorIn the final three months of 2014, the cost of a barrel of Brent crude was $77. In the final three months of 2015, it was $44.Today it is $34. That is the background to today's results from BP.Bob Dudley, BP's chief executive, told me two weeks ago that he expected the oil price to rise as high as$50-60 a barrel by the end of the year, as the oil majors desperately cut production and demand grows from China and the US.Global supply and demand, at least from his company's point of view, will be in better balance, he argued.It is clear from the strain the low oil price is putting on BP that another year of falling prices will mean yet more job losses in both the upstream (oil exploration and production, including the North Sea) and downstream (refining and sale of fuel) businesses.Both of the main engines of the business are now spluttering and puffing out uncomfortable-looking black smoke.That will put fresh pressure on BP's dividend, vital to our savings and pension funds. For the moment, BP says it is wholly committed to maintaining the payments.More from KamalMichael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said BP faced hard choices: \"With average oil prices still trading at multi-year lows so far this year, the question now needs to be asked, how long can BP sustain the dividend at current levels without an imminent pick-up in oil prices? \"How many more jobs will BP need to cut from its already reduced 80,000 workforce in the coming months in order to sustain its payout against a backdrop of a possible ratings downgrade, and lower energy prices for longer? \"BP's results are the latest in a round of weak fourth-quarter results in the sector.Last week, Chevron announced its first quarterly loss in more than 13 years.Shell, which reports its fourth-quarter and full-year results on Thursday, has warned in a trading statement that its underlying profits could be halved.BP's shares ended trading 8.7% lower at 335.1p.",

The company has been struggling to cope with the sharp decline in oil prices, which has put pressure on its profits and forced it to reduce costs.BP's results were also affected by a $433 million charge related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The company has set aside a total of $55.5 billion to cover the costs of the disaster, which was one of the worst environmental catastrophes in history.Despite the challenges, BP said it would maintain its dividend payout to shareholders, which will be $0.10 per share for the fourth quarter. The company has come under pressure from investors to reduce its dividend in light of the falling oil prices, but Mr. Dudley said that the payout was \"sustainable\" and that the company was committed to maintaining it.BP's shares fell sharply on the news, dropping 5.5% to 326p in early trading on the London Stock Exchange.

Why would you not do that? \"The businessman visited King Solomon Academy in London - a school which serves a poor area, but has achieved the best GCSE results of any non-selective school in England.The headteacher, Max Haimendorf, told BBC Scotland much of that success was down to being independent of local authority control.He said: \"The governors, the people who work sort of behind the school, very ambitious people, both successful in business, and they wanted to kind of make something happen for this community and in education. \"\"That led to a level of ambition and that doesn't necessarily mean just replicating what has happened before.

It was Donald Trump's election, and the inward turn America is taking, that spurred the EU and Japan to overcome their differences. Both want to show domestic audiences they can deliver signature deals that promise new economic opportunities.They also want to send a clear message internationally that the EU and Japan, highly-developed democracies, remain committed to a liberal, free-trading, rules-based world, and they will seek to shape it even if the US won't.The outline plan was signed in Brussels after a meeting between the Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, and the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, on the eve of a meeting of the G20 group of leading economies in Hamburg.It comes hard on the heels of the collapse of a long-awaited trade agreement between Japan, the US and other Pacific ring countries, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was scrapped in January by US President Donald Trump.The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the agreement showed the EU's commitment to world trade: \"We did it. We concluded EU-Japan political and trade talks. EU is more and more engaged globally. \"Mr Tusk also said the deal countered the argument put forward by some of those in favour of Brexit that the EU was unable to promote free trade: \"Although some are saying that the time of isolationism and disintegration is coming again, we are demonstrating that this is not the case. \"He added that the deal was not just about common trade interests, but reflected \"the shared values that underpin our societies, by which I mean liberal democracy, human rights and the rule of law\".Japan is the world's third-largest economy, with a population of about 127 million.As it stands, the country is Europe's seventh biggest export market.One of the most important trade categories for the EU is dairy goods.Japan's appetite for milk and milk-based products has been growing steadily in recent years.The EU's dairy farmers are struggling with falling demand in its home nations and an ultra-competitive buying climate, which farmers say means they are paid less than the cost of production.Even once the agreement is fully signed, the deal is likely to have in place long transition clauses of up to 15 years to allow sectors in both countries time to adjust to the new outside competition.",

So far, it is believed that the two attackers, who were both killed by police, were inspired by the Islamic State (IS) and had been radicalized online.The attack has raised concerns about the spread of radical ideology in France, particularly among young people. The government has announced plans to increase funding for programs aimed at preventing radicalization and promoting community cohesion.In the meantime, the people of Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray are coming together to support each other and to honor the memory of Father Jacques. A memorial service was held at the church where he was killed, with hundreds of people attending to pay their respects.The service was led by the Bishop of Rouen, who praised Father Jacques for his bravery and selflessness. \"He gave his life to protect others, and that is the ultimate act of love and sacrifice,\" the Bishop said.As the town begins to heal, many are calling for greater unity and solidarity in the face of terrorism. \"We must stand together and reject the hatred and violence that seeks to divide us,\" said the Mayor of Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray.The attack on Father Jacques has also sparked a wider debate about the role of religion in French society. While some have called for greater security measures to protect places of worship, others have argued that this would be a step backwards for a country that values freedom of religion and expression.For now, the people of Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray are focused on mourning the loss of their beloved priest and on rebuilding their community. As one resident said, \"We will get through this, but we will never forget the sacrifice that Father Jacques made for us.\"In a show of solidarity, people from across France are flocking to Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray to pay their respects to Father Jacques and to stand in unity against terrorism.

The country has been on high alert since the Nice truck attack on Bastille Day, which killed 84 people.French President Francois Hollande has condemned the attack, saying it was a \"vile terrorist act\" and that France would continue to fight against terrorism. \"We will not give in to fear, we will not give in to hatred,\" he said.The attack has also sparked widespread outrage and condemnation from around the world. Pope Francis has expressed his \"pain and horror\" at the killing of Father Jacques, and has called for an end to violence in the name of God.The investigation into the attack is ongoing, with authorities working to determine the extent of the attackers' connections to IS and whether they had any accomplices.In the meantime, the people of Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray are coming to terms with the brutal attack on their community. Father Jacques, who was known for his kindness and dedication to his parish, has been remembered as a hero who gave his life to protect others.As the town begins to mourn, many are left wondering how such a horrific attack could have occurred in a place of worship. \"It's a tragedy, a tragedy,\" said one local resident. \"We never thought it could happen here.\"The attack has also raised questions about the security of churches and other places of worship in France. The government has announced plans to increase security measures, including the deployment of additional police and military personnel to protect sensitive sites.As the investigation continues, one thing is clear: the people of France will not be intimidated by this latest act of terrorism. As one resident of Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray said, \"We will not be afraid. We will stand together and fight against hatred and violence.\" The town of Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray is still reeling from the shock of the brutal attack on Father Jacques, with many residents struggling to come to terms with the senseless violence that occurred in their community.\"It's like a nightmare that we can't wake up from,\" said Marie, a local resident who knew Father Jacques personally. \"He was such a kind and gentle soul, always willing to lend a helping hand. It's just devastating to think that he's gone.\"As the investigation into the attack continues, authorities are working to piece together the events leading up to the murder."

        "sample_text2": "As the dust settles on the EU deal, attention is already turning to the next phase of the battle: winning over the British public. Cameron and his allies in the \"Remain\" camp face a daunting task in convincing a skeptical electorate that the reforms secured are sufficient to justify continued membership in the EU.Polls suggest that the British public remains deeply divided on the issue, with many voters still undecided or leaning towards leaving the EU. The \"Leave\" campaign, led by figures such as Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, has been quick to seize on perceived weaknesses in the deal, arguing that it does not go far enough in addressing concerns over sovereignty and immigration.One of the key challenges facing the \"Remain\" camp is the perception that the EU deal is a series of vague promises and compromises, rather than a fundamental transformation of the UK's relationship with the EU. Critics argue that the reforms secured by Cameron are largely symbolic, and that the UK will still be subject to many of the same EU rules and regulations as before.In response, Cameron and his allies are likely to focus on the economic benefits of EU membership, highlighting the potential risks to trade and investment if the UK were to leave the EU. They will also seek to reassure voters that the reforms secured will give the UK a greater degree of control over its own affairs, while still allowing it to participate in the EU's single market.However, the \"Leave\" campaign is unlikely to let up in its attacks on the deal, and is likely to focus on the issue of immigration as a key battleground. The seven-year ban on in-work benefits for EU migrants may be seen as a concession to the UK's concerns, but it is unlikely to satisfy those who believe that the free movement of people is a fundamental flaw in the EU's design.As the referendum campaign heats up, it is clear that the next few months will be a crucial period in the UK's history. The outcome of the vote will have far-reaching consequences for the UK's relationship with the EU, and for the country's place in the world. One thing is certain: the debate over the UK's membership in the EU is far from over, and the coming weeks and months will be filled with intense and passionate argument on both sides.",

As the dust settles on the EU deal, attention is already turning to the next phase of the battle: winning over the British public. Cameron and his allies in the \"Remain\" camp face a daunting task in convincing a skeptical electorate that the reforms secured are sufficient to justify continued membership in the EU.Polls suggest that the British public remains deeply divided on the issue, with many voters still undecided or leaning towards leaving the EU. The \"Leave\" campaign, led by figures such as Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, has been quick to seize on perceived weaknesses in the deal, arguing that it does not go far enough in addressing concerns over sovereignty and immigration.One of the key challenges facing the \"Remain\" camp is the perception that the EU deal is a series of vague promises and compromises, rather than a fundamental transformation of the UK's relationship with the EU."

        "text": "If intensive care units, for example, are full then there are no available beds there for patients who need them to recover from serious scheduled operations.If that is the case -  some elective surgery will inevitably get postponed.Late last year, the Welsh Government pledged an extra \u00c2\u00a345m to health boards to try make sure scheduled, elective surgery and treatments are  more protected this winter.NHS Wales chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall said it was still too early to tell in terms of numbers but hospitals needed to ensure elective surgery was managed in a \"sensible manner\" as there was a duty to patients.Another interesting thing to note - sometimes the figures show that unscheduled care units actually see a greater number of patients during the summer months - due to trips, slips, falls, bumps and so on.But in winter the NHS often has to deal with more severely-ill patients, for example elderly patients who have breathing problems.These need much more care, spend more time in the system and need more support to get better.COMPARING WALES WITH ENGLANDHistorically A&E waits have been longer in Wales than in England. Some experts argue that is because there is a bigger mismatch in Wales between the number of beds available and the demand for them.The difference might also reflect demographic factors -  for example the Welsh population as a whole being older sicker and less well-off than other parts of the UK.It is not straightforward comparing Wales with the NHS in England, because the \"clock\" starts differently when patients arrive.For those in Wales, the waiting time starts being recorded as soon as the patient is registered inside the A&E department - or when the ambulance crew notifies the desk they have arrived outside.In England, the arrival time starts when the patient is handed over or 15 minutes after the ambulance arrives at A&E, whichever is earlier.Leaked data for NHS England seen by BBC News shows the figure reached a low of 75.8% on 3 January but had recovered to 82.4% last week.HOW DO DIFFERENT HOSPITALS COMPARE?ARE THINGS GETTING MORE DIFFICULT?Looking back at A&E waiting times statistics in Wales over recent years - what is clear is that in each successive year things appear to be getting ever more difficult - despite the Welsh Government ploughing more money each year to help health boards deliver they're winter plans.What is not in doubt though is staff on the front line are trying hard to make sure patients get treated safely - even when the pressure is really on.The problem is the pressures year on year show little sign of easing.",

The bill, which aims to pave the way for the UK's exit from the European Union, was passed by a narrow margin of 308 to 297.Reckless, who has been a vocal supporter of Brexit, faced criticism from opposition parties and some of his own Conservative colleagues for his absence from the vote. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, tweeted that Reckless's absence was \"unacceptable\" and that he had \"let his constituents down\".However, Reckless has defended his decision, saying that he did not want to risk making a mistake or embarrassing himself or his party by voting while under the influence. \"I'm a human being, and I made a mistake,\" he said. \"I'm not proud of it, but I'm being honest about it.\"The MP's admission has sparked a wider debate about the culture of drinking in Westminster and the potential impact it could have on the decision-making process. Some have called for MPs to be banned from drinking in the Commons, while others have argued that it is up to individual MPs to take responsibility for their own behavior.Reckless's apology has been accepted by Conservative Party whips, and he is not expected to face any disciplinary action. However, the incident is likely to remain a topic of discussion in the coming days, with many calling for greater accountability and transparency from MPs."

You get, essentially, one of Zion's most massive cliffs collapsing, running across the canyon in 20 seconds with peak velocities of 90 metres per second (200mph),\" said Dr Moore.It is still not clear from the investigations what caused the rock avalanche. There is insufficient data on palaeo-earthquakes in the area to make a statement about a seismic trigger. It remains a possibility, but so too does a simple internal failure of the rock.And while there is evidence for other rock avalanches in the canyon, Dr Moore says a repeat event is not something the National Parks Service nor tourists should be unduly worried about.Just marvel at the spectacle, he urges. \"People when they go there, they look up to the huge Navajo sandstone cliffs, and I think it's a little more subtle to look down at our feet and wonder why this canyon is so accessible, why the valley floor is so flat? \"Studying landslides for my job, the story I tell is often connected to a lot of gloom and doom.

The future of the steel industry, and the thousands of jobs it supports, depends on it.\" The crisis in the steel industry has sparked a heated debate about the role of government in supporting key industries. While some argue that the government should not intervene in the market, others believe that it has a responsibility to protect jobs and communities.\"The steel industry is a vital part of our manufacturing base, and it's essential that the government takes steps to support it,\" said Labour MP, Anna Turley."

The Welsh government and the MoD are working hard to fill the gap. \"St Athan's history as an aircraft maintenance base dates back to 1938.Just before and during World War II many different types of aircraft were assembled, test flown and maintained there by a staff of 14,000, and the base inevitably became a target for German bombers.By the mid-1990s there were 3,500 engineers repairing fighter jets.But since then the St Athan site has since endured more than a decade of uncertainty and failed attempts to secure skilled jobs.In 2000 the Red Dragon Project began, aimed at modernising the ageing MoD facilities there, along with the construction of a \u00a377m super hangar for fast jet repair.The main tenant for the new super hangar was to be the Defence Aviation Repair Agency, Dara.But in 2005, UK ministers announced they were closing the fast jet business at St Athan, with the loss of hundreds of jobs.In March 2009 the National Audit Office and the Wales Audit Office criticised both the MoD and Welsh authorities after it had cost the taxpayer \u00a3113m and failed to deliver thousands of jobs.The then Defence Minister Quentin Davies revealed in November 2009 that nearly 340 jobs would be lost at the base in south Wales by June 2013 at the latest.In October 2010, a \u00a314bn defence training academy which would have created 2,000 jobs at St Athan was scrapped as part of 8% cuts by the UK government to the defence budget.At that time there were around 400 civilian staff left at the base.But the operation has been gradually wound down as the contract to service the VC-10 tanker aircraft came to an end.Mr Lindsay added: \"The buildings are there. It's available. Let's hope somebody else comes. \"The Welsh government said there was significant private sector interest in the newly designated St Athan Enterprise Zone.It said it was working to attract new companies to the area capable of creating sustainable jobs for local people.A spokesman said Cardiff Airport and other key employment sites and development proposals in the immediate vicinity were now being included in the enterprise zone. \"Potential employers are made aware of the skills mix available,\" said the spokesperson.",

Scientists say it is likely that you can now make sense of it.It is the brain's ability to fill in the blanks that could help explain why some people suffer from hallucinations.One of the study's authors, Dr Christoph Teufel, from Cardiff University, said: \"Vision is a constructive process - in other words, our brain makes up the world that we 'see'. \"It fills in the blanks, ignoring the things that don't quite fit, and presents to us an image of the world that has been edited and made to fit with what we expect. \"An example of this would be a person walking into their living room and identifying a fast-moving black shape as their cat, despite the fact the visual information was no more than a blur.The sensory input was minimal and prior knowledge did the creative work.Prof Paul Fletcher of the University of Cambridge said: \"Having a predictive brain is very useful - it makes us efficient and adept at creating a coherent picture of an ambiguous and complex world. \"But it also means that we are not very far away from perceiving things that aren't actually there, which is the definition of a hallucination. \"He added that \"altered perceptual experiences\" are not limited to people with mental illnesses, but have been seen in a milder form across the whole population.",

The goal was a result of some poor defending from Dundee United, and it seemed to spark the home team into life.Van der Velden's equalizer in the 55th minute was a highlight of the match, as he flicked the ball over two defenders before calmly slotting the ball past the goalkeeper. The goal seemed to give Dundee United a boost, and they began to create more chances.However, despite their dominance, they were unable to find a winner. Cammy Smith and Tope Obadeyi both had chances, but were denied by some excellent goalkeeping from Lee Robinson.At the other end, Dundee United goalkeeper Cammy Bell was also called into action, making some crucial saves to prevent Queen of the South from taking the lead again.In the end, the match ended 1-1, a result that left both teams feeling frustrated. Dundee United will be disappointed not to have taken all three points, while Queen of the South will feel that they could have won the game if they had taken their chances.The draw leaves Dundee United in 5th place in the Scottish Championship, while Queen of the South remain in 7th place.

        "final_sample_text": "Despite dominating possession, the Tannadice side struggled to create clear-cut chances, and it took a moment of individual brilliance from midfielder Willem van der Velden to level the score.\"We didn't do enough to win the game,\" McKinnon said in his post-match interview. \"We had a lot of possession, but we didn't create enough chances. We didn't have the intensity and urgency that we needed to win the game.\"The visitors, Queen of the South, took the lead in the 35th minute through Mark Millar, who scored against his former club. The goal was a result of some poor defending from Dundee United, and it seemed to spark the home team into life.Van der Velden's equalizer in the 55th minute was a highlight of the match, as he flicked the ball over two defenders before calmly slotting the ball past the goalkeeper. The goal seemed to give Dundee United a boost, and they began to create more chances.However, despite their dominance, they were unable to find a winner. Cammy Smith and Tope Obadeyi both had chances, but were denied by some excellent goalkeeping from Lee Robinson.At the other end, Dundee United goalkeeper Cammy Bell was also called into action, making some crucial saves to prevent Queen of the South from taking the lead again.In the end, the match ended 1-1, a result that left both teams feeling frustrated. Dundee United will be disappointed not to have taken all three points, while Queen of the South will feel that they could have won the game if they had taken their chances.The draw leaves Dundee United in 5th place in the Scottish Championship, while Queen of the South remain in 7th place. Both teams will be looking to improve their form in their next matches, with Dundee United facing a tough trip to Falkirk and Queen of the South hosting Ayr United.In other news, Stephen Dobbie, who made a substitute appearance for Queen of the South, was denied a goal by a brilliant block from Cammy Bell.

These included the creation of a civilian oversight board to review police conduct and the implementation of de-escalation training for officers.However, the acquittal of Heaggan-Brown also had a profound impact on the community, leading to a breakdown in trust between law enforcement and the people they serve. Many residents of Milwaukee's predominantly African American neighborhoods reported feeling fearful and mistrustful of the police, and some said they were reluctant to call 911 even in emergency situations.The case also had a personal impact on Heaggan-Brown, who was fired from the police department shortly after the acquittal. He has since struggled to find employment and has become a symbol of the controversy surrounding police violence and racial injustice.In the end, the shooting of Sylville Smith and the acquittal of Dominique Heaggan-Brown served as a painful reminder of the deep-seated issues that plague our society.

        "text": "For these approved products and services, countries have the scope to charge VAT at a reduced rate of no less than 5%.The UK has long applied a 5% rate to the installation of domestic energy-saving products for anyone over the age of 60 who is unemployed, disabled or claiming benefits such as income support or housing benefit.But last year, the European Court of Justice said this was a breach of EU laws as the products and services concerned did not fall within the VAT directive which only exempts the \"provision, construction, renovation and alteration of housing as part of social policy\" and the \"renovation and repairing of private dwellings\".The UK has yet to decide how to respond to the ruling although it face financial penalties if it does not abide by the judgement.Labour says VAT could rise to at least 15% as early as August unless the chancellor takes immediate action.The opposition, which has been critical of cuts to solar and renewable subsidies, has tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill \"empowering\" George Osborne to set a zero rates on insulation and renewable materials or, alternatively, to compensate the industry for the financial impact that any VAT rise would have on jobs and investment.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary Lisa Nandy said the \"solar tax\" will \"destroy thousands of jobs\". \"Reversing it is well within the chancellor's power. He must act to protect this important British industry. \"Labour's amendment, expected to come to a vote on Tuesday, has won the support of a dozen Tories who are unhappy about EU control over UK tax rates and seeking to highlight the issue in the run-up to June's EU referendum.Those backing it include former ministers Tim Loughton and Peter Lilley and Graham Brady, chair of the influential 1922 committee of backbench Conservatives - all of whom want the UK to leave the EU.Paul Scully, the MP for Sutton and Cheam who is backing EU exit, told the BBC's Daily Politics the situation was \"absolutely outrageous\" and he was \"seriously considering\" voting with Labour. \"At the end of the day this should be a UK-made decision,\" he said. \"You have a situation where we can look at a sugar tax, where we penalising people for doing something the government does not believe is right, but we can't reward the government for doing something we think is the right thing to do. \"If the SNP and the Lib Dems also support the amendment, the government could be at risk of defeat as it only has a working majority of 17 in the House of Commons.",

Eurosceptics argue that the EU's VAT rules are an example of Brussels' overreach and that the UK should be able to set its own tax rates without interference from the EU.However, supporters of the EU argue that the harmonization of VAT rates helps to create a level playing field across the single market and prevents member states from engaging in unfair tax competition.The row over VAT rates comes as the UK prepares to vote on its membership in the EU in June. The \"Brexit\" campaign has seized on the issue as an example of the EU's interference in UK affairs, while the \"Remain\" campaign argues that the UK's membership in the EU brings economic benefits and that the EU is willing to work with the UK to address its concerns.The European Commission's proposal to give member states more flexibility over VAT rates is seen as a concession to the UK and other member states that have called for greater autonomy over tax policy.

And so the show's purpose has changed somewhat - shifting into an event that is as much about spotting momentum rather than new products.But perhaps somewhere in the vast halls of the Las Vegas Convention Centre we've seen this year's VCR - a technology that will have impact well beyond what we can predict.Attendees - some 170,000 of them - are now heading home. And there seems to be a general consensus that CES 2016 signalled a transition year, but not a revolutionary one. The big ideas - like virtual reality, reinventing the car, or home robotics - were promising but still half-baked, a bun in the metaphorical (smart) oven. \"We're in an in-between phase, where categories like drones, virtual reality, and wearables are growing and advancing, but still have a long way to go,\" wrote Rachel Metz from MIT Tech Review.The New York Times' Farhad Manjoo described CES 2016 as an \"awkward adolescence\" for emerging technologies.And that's absolutely right. VR has yet to go mainstream. Drones are out there, but set to be locked in regulatory hassle for the next year at least. And wearables? Well, let's just say too many companies are still thinking about function before fashion.CES 2016 was like it is every year: Big, overwhelming, full of terrible ideas, wasted money and overhyped nonsense.Gone are the days where you find the \"next big thing\" at CES.

One thing is clear: the Philippines' commitment to upholding the rule of law has sent a strong message to China and the rest of the world."

Taggart's ratings within the STV region remained strong.But when the series was shown on the network a few months later, it was a different story. Taggart's ratings across the UK fell to 3.8 million for the most recent series - considered poor for a mainstream drama.In recent years, ITV has axed a number of long-running dramas - notably Heartbeat and The Bill - to put more effort into bringing new shows to the screen.Although Taggart had lost its popularity on ITV1, it remains popular in Scotland and is important to STV commercially and the television industry in Scotland.For instance, STV generates money from Taggart through sales to foreign broadcasters - over the years it has been screened in many countries around the world.Distributor DRG said Taggart was a \"hugely popular\" series internationally, airing across three different TV channels in Australia alone.A DRG spokesperson added: \"It's our shared ambition to return Taggart to UK screens and we can confirm we're currently working closely with STV as we explore options to achieve this. \"ITV did recently commission another drama from STV - a 90-minute one-off called Fast Freddie, The Widow and Me, which is expected to be shown over Christmas.STV and ITV recently ended a long-running legal dispute amicably.

However, they remained focused and composed, and their experience and skill ultimately paid off.The British sailing team's success in Rio is a result of years of hard work and dedication, as well as a strong support system and investment in the sport. The team's performance is a testament to the talent and determination of British sailors, and is sure to inspire a new generation of young sailors to take up the sport.In a statement, Mills and Clark said: \"We're absolutely thrilled to have won gold.

There should just be one class on the train. \"\"People will see less first class in the future as we start to say that on busy suburban trains you can't start segregating,\" he added.The Department for Transport issues contracts to run rail franchises in England, and can include conditions such as whether first class seating should be provided.In March, ahead of contract negotiations to run the Southeastern franchise, passengers were asked if they wanted to remove first class seats at busy times.The contract to run the line - which serves south-east London, Kent and parts of East Sussex - expires next year.Other franchises to be renewed in the next 12 months include the West Coast Main Line from April 2019, and the East Midlands regional contract, which has three firms bidding to run the contract from March 2018.However, some are not due for renewal for several years, with the Northern and East Anglia franchises currently not due for renewal until 2025.David Sidebottom, director of Transport Focus - which represents passengers - said it was important train users have a choice, \"as long as that choice is not to the extreme detriment of everyone else\". \"A balance needs to be achieved between the number of standard and first class carriages a train has,\" he added. \"However, it is clear that where passengers are being squeezed into standard class carriages while there are plenty of empty seats in first class, this balance is not being achieved. \"In the long-term we need a big increase in capacity. This means continued investment in new and longer trains to meet existing demand. \"Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group - which represents train operators - said firms were prepared to work with the government over the issue. \"We understand passengers' frustration when they can't get a seat which is why rail companies are working together to invest and improve journeys with thousands of new carriages and 6,400 extra train services a week by 2021,\" he said. \"We will continue to work with governments to increase seats on key routes to boost communities, businesses and the economy.\"",

        "sample_text2": "The proposal to scrap first-class carriages on shorter, commuter routes has sparked a heated debate among commuters, transport experts, and train operators. While some have welcomed the move as a necessary step to address overcrowding, others have expressed concerns about the potential impact on passenger comfort and the financial viability of train operators.One of the main concerns is that the abolition of first-class seating would lead to a loss of revenue for train operators, which could have a knock-on effect on the quality of services and the ability to invest in infrastructure. The Rail Delivery Group has warned that the removal of first-class seating could result in a significant reduction in revenue, which could be detrimental to the long-term sustainability of the rail network.Furthermore, some passengers have expressed concerns about the potential impact on comfort and amenities. First-class seating often provides additional legroom, quieter carriages, and complimentary food and drink services, which are highly valued by many commuters. The removal of these amenities could lead to a decline in passenger satisfaction and a decrease in the overall quality of the commuting experience.On the other hand, proponents of the plan argue that the benefits of increased capacity and reduced overcrowding would outweigh any potential losses. By removing first-class seating, trains could accommodate more passengers during peak hours, reducing the pressure on the network and making commuting more efficient.The Transport Secretary's comments have also sparked a wider debate about the future of the UK's rail network. Many experts argue that the network is in need of significant investment and reform to meet the growing demands of passengers. The UK's rail network is one of the most congested in Europe, with many commuters facing delays, cancellations, and overcrowding on a daily basis.In recent years, there have been calls for greater investment in the rail network, including the electrification of more lines, the introduction of new trains, and the improvement of station facilities. However, the government has faced criticism for its handling of the rail network, with some accusing it of prioritizing cost-cutting measures over passenger needs.As the debate around the future of first-class seating on commuter trains continues, it is clear that the UK's rail network is at a crossroads. The government must balance the need to address overcrowding and improve services with the need to ensure the long-term sustainability of the network. Ultimately, the fate of first-class seating on commuter trains will depend on the government's ability to strike a balance between these competing demands.",

        "text": "He had suffered severe head injuries.Three years later, Yam, 54, was convicted of murder after two semi-secret trials that excluded the press and public.Prosecutors said Yam killed the author to plunder his wealth - but the secret part of the trial covered almost all of the case for the defence and the Crown's response to it.A judge granted that secrecy order, believed to be the first since the World War Two, after hearing that prosecutors might have otherwise dropped the case.Before it went behind closed doors, the court heard Yam claimed to have been given Mr Chappelow's cheques, credit cards and banking information by \"gangsters\" with Chinese names and that he had been assembling evidence as a means of turning them in.During his subsequent and failed appeal, it emerged there had been four defence witnesses behind closed doors - and his lawyers said others capable of supporting his case could have come forward had there been publicity.Who is Wang Yam?Now serving a minimum 20-year-sentence, he has since asked the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg to intervene. However its review of whether he received a fair trial has been in limbo because the British courts won't disclose the secret material.In a unanimous judgement on Wednesday, a Supreme Court panel of seven judges backed that decision - saying English courts could block disclosure on national security grounds, even if the material was at the heart of an appeal.Lord Mance, the lead judge on the panel of seven, said: \"The appellant has not made good the proposition which he needs to establish, namely that there are no circumstances in which refusal to permit disclosure of the in-camera [secret] material to the European Court of Human Rights in the appellant's response could be justified. \"Under the international rules governing the European Court, each state promises not to stand in the way of anyone who wants to seek its help.But the Supreme Court said the long-established block on revealing national security material did not compromise that principle.

This method relies on staring at these suns, hoping to catch an object passing in front. When such a \"transit\" occurs, there is a tell-tale decrease in starlight.The US space agency's Kepler telescope has identified more than a thousand planets this way.If intelligent civilisations are out there, it is safe to assume they too will be looking for other worlds - like ours - using the same idea, believe Kipping and Teachey.According to the pair's calculations, emitting a continuous 30-megawatt laser for about 10 hours, once a year, would be enough to distort the characteristic dip in light when Earth transited the Sun, as viewed from an alien Kepler telescope. \"It doesn't have to be one huge laser; it could be an array positioned around the Earth. Or you could put it in space as a satellite, and we've calculated that the International Space Station already collects exactly the amount of energy we would need,\" Prof Kipping told BBC News.This is true for a laser system working in visible light. Prof Kipping concedes, however, that a laser cloak that covers all wavelengths, not just the visible colours, would need a very large array of tuneable lasers with a total power of 250MW.But an alternative might be to use a laser simply to disguise the interesting aspects about Earth - features in its atmosphere that betray the fact that life exists here. These are a suite of gases that include oxygen, ozone and methane. \"If we just cloaked out those biosignatures then another civilisation might detect our planet through a transit, everything would add up, but Earth would appear as a dead world and they'd soon lose interest,\" Prof Kipping added.The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (Seti) is the collective term used to describe positive efforts to detect and contact alien life. A number of experiments are currently under way that are trying to see if aliens are actually signalling us with lasers.But just as with the attempts to detect the radio transmissions from aliens, this \"optical Seti\" approach, as it is known, has also found nothing of interest among the stars\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 yet.",

But by paying them it is the asylum seekers who become the real enemy while people smugglers can help us out by turning their boats back,\" he explains. \"It is the ultimate PR triumph. \"Others think Mr Abbott is testing the public's appetite for tougher action on asylum seekers.The government will be wondering whether people are willing to let them stop the boats at any cost, says political scientist in the School of Social Sciences at Monash University, Dr Zareh Ghazarian.By using phrases such as \"by hook or by crook\", Mr Abbott is reminding people how far he is willing to go to deliver on his election promise to stop the boats, says Dr Ghazarian, without committing himself on the payment issue. \"Asylum seekers and stopping the boats is arguably the government's one political achievement,\" he says. \"If they can't manage the asylum seeker issue and the boats start arriving again in the numbers we have seen in past years they will have lost credibility on this issue. \"Social commentator and writer Jane Caro agrees. \"Stopping the boats is the only real success story for the government to hang its hat on,\" says Ms Caro, noting that it is a policy that remains popular with most Australians. \"I am speculating but Mr Abbott will be thinking that eventually [stopping the boats] will get tougher and he is not willing to remove anything from his bag of tricks,\" she says. \"Here is a prime minister who is reserving his options.\"",

According to the researchers, the extended lifespan of post-menopausal females may have evolved as a result of their ability to provide critical support to their grandchildren, increasing their chances of survival and success.In many species, including humans, grandmothers play a vital role in childcare, providing food, protection, and wisdom to their grandchildren.

That's not what's supposed to happen.Disaster, it's a false start!A false start happens when an athlete begins a race before the official signal has been given.They can't start running until after the starter's gun has been fired.The Jamaican sprinter is well known for starting his races slowly. Some scientists think this is because Bolt is so tall, making it hard for him to get up to full speed quickly.He makes up for the slower starts with his long strides catching other racers further down the track.Normally, judging by all the gold medals he's won, his slow start clearly doesn't cause him any problems.Usain said: \"I have worked hard on my start all season. In the first round of the 100m it was perfect, in the second it was OK. But in the final I think I was suffering from anxiety, I was ready to go and get on the track and run. I think anxiety got the best of me. \"In the past, athletes were allowed one false start before being disqualified from a race if they did it a second time.But in 2010, new rules were introduced by the people in charge of athletics, the International Association of Athletic Federations, which disqualified athletes after just one false start.Many people did not agree with the new rules as they believed that everyone should allowed a second chance.After Bolt was disqualified from the 2011 final, his training partner Yohan Blake took gold in 9.92 seconds - 0.4 seconds slower than Bolt's world record.It wasn't the end of the Bolt's World Championships though.He went on to win the 200m and 4x100m relay with his Jamaica teammates.Usain then continued to dominate athletics for the next six years.",

The results will be used as a starting point to chart children's progress throughout primary school.Ministers have insisted that the move will help ensure children leave primary school with a good standard of reading, writing and maths.But the NUT's resolution argues that the primary curriculum is over-crowded and restrictive and that a focus on \"high-stakes testing\" is having a negative impact on children's education.",

While a few improvements will be made next year, most of the serious spending isn't likely to happen until after 2019.But if they can get through that, they will find 19 questions to answer.Some are fairly predictable: What should be the key priorities of the new franchise, how many trains an hour should there be, do passengers value cross country services like the one between Norwich and Liverpool?But there are also some fairly contentious ones: Should first class seating be removed to allow more space for standard class passengers and should there be more staff on duty at stations and on the trains?And there are a couple of questions which are guaranteed to get respondents going. \"Are there any examples of outstanding customer service experiences which you believe the East Anglia rail franchise should  aspire to? \"Or how about this one: \"How can the franchise operator help you better during planned and unplanned disruption? \"Passengers could have a field day with that after a year that's seen a catalogue of problems on the main line through Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk.Government consultations are normally responded to by local politicians and a handful of pressure groups but already social media has been buzzing with suggestions and comments about this one.Mrs Perry is likely to have a lot of reading to do.",

They say they have been digging bodies out of the rubble, and that they were assaulted with tanks, heavy machine guns, mortars: heavy weapons of a type that only the government possesses.The Free Syrian Army did use some of its weapons in reply to that but it has only light weapons. It says that these deaths can only be attributed to the government.There were very inflated claims for the numbers of deaths in last night's assault at the beginning - figures of 200 and even higher were being discussed. But now independent and reputable human rights groups are talking about a death toll in the region of 55.However people in the worst affected suburb, Khalidiya, were describing digging 100 bodies out of the rubble, so the true figure may be somewhere in between.Across Syria a picture is emerging of government forces holding the centre of big towns and the main roads, and the Free Syrian Army becoming increasingly active and almost controlling parts of cities like Homs and areas of the countryside.These men have only very light weapons - machine-guns and rocket propelled grenades - and they have no answer when government forces decide to use heavy weapons, as they appear to have done overnight.It is a very, very bad day for Syria if the numbers are anything like even the lowest estimate.Once the death toll is established, who is responsible becomes the question.Already there are completely different accounts from the Syrian government and the Syrian opposition.Why did this take place on the day the UN Security Council was voting on a motion critic of Syria?It could be because the Free Syrian Army have been so successful that areas of Homs have slipped from the government's grasp. I think the government army commanders on the ground simply thought they could not wait any longer.The Free Syrian Army told me this morning that they were going to conduct what they call a \"general offensive\" in reply to what has happened in Homs.I think we are going to see an escalation in the violence. We are seeing bigger and bigger attacks by the Free Syrian Army.On Friday we followed an attack on an army base outside Homs. The fighters said they had over 100 men - I counted at least 60.

        "text": "And particularly not stoats. \"And the stoats are an incredibly efficient predator. Literally, where there are stoats, New Zealand native birds do not prosper. \"And, in particular, they are really bad news for our native kiwi bird. So, where stoats are present, very few juveniles get to one year of age. In fact, probably, we lose 90% of individuals. \"In New Zealand there has been a huge campaign to trap and poison stoats. And that's sometimes been controversial, because poison is applied - albeit in a targeted fashion - by helicopter.So the hope is that once the population has been reduced you could then - counter-intuitively - introduce more stoats. But they would be secret agents with genetic modifications.For example, they may be engineered only to have male offspring and to pass that characteristic on to their progeny.So, over time, it would be harder and harder for the population to reproduce itself.Releasing genetically-engineered creatures that can't breed into the landscape - that sounds familiar. Ah, yes. It's the plot of the Jurassic Park movies. And if they've taught us anything, it is that life will find a way.I was worried Prof Gemmell might laugh at the idea. But, in fact, he took it seriously. \"Nature will find a way\", he agreed. \"And the way is normally mutation. And that was exactly what happened in Jurassic Park. \"But, he said, scientists can do a couple of things to counter-act that. \"You can put in back-up systems to make sure that the gene drive keeps working. And then, you have to go out and monitor things. You can't just walk away from it. You have to keep an eye on what's happening in the population.And he says there may be other factors that make such a scheme more difficult than expected. \"For example, what happens if female stoats don't find the male stoats that carry the damaged genes attractive, and don't want to mate with them? \"That would be a problem. And will these stoats, that have been bred in the laboratory, survive in the wild? \"So there's a fair bit we need to figure out first before we get to a point where we actually have genetically-modified stoats to deploy either in New Zealand or in Orkney,\" said Prof Gemmell.",

Mercedes eventually called him in to retire with five laps to go.The incident between the Mercedes drivers played into the hands of Red Bull, who had been expected to struggle on this track because of their Renault engine's power deficit to the Mercedes.The team tried to neutralise that by running a smaller rear wing than their rivals, relying on the car's standard-setting under-body downforce for grip.When Vettel ran wide at the fast Pouhon left-hander on lap five - his second driving error in as many races - Ricciardo swooped past to move into second and put the pressure on Rosberg.Rosberg made his first pit stop early, after just eight laps, because of the extra wear his loss of front downforce was causing his tyres and the time lost allowed Ricciardo into the lead.The Australian drove superbly to build a lead for himself and seemed set for a comfortable win before Rosberg's late stop, with 10 laps to go, raised the possibility of the German catching him.The stop dropped Rosberg to 20 seconds behind Ricciardo but he soon began closing at more than two seconds a lap. However, the Red Bull had enough to hold him off for his third victory of an increasingly impressive first season with a front-running team.Bottas drove a measured race to pass Raikkonen for third in the closing laps, as the Ferrari driver finally found some of the form he has been lacking all season.Raikkonen made ground with an early pit stop and ran in the top three most of the race before losing out to Bottas with eight laps to go.In the second Ferrari, Fernando Alonso found himself having to fight back after being forced to serve a five-second penalty at his first pit stop.That dropped him into a fight with the McLaren of Kevin Magnussen, who proved very difficult to pass as a result of the greater power of his Mercedes engine.Magnussen's delaying of Alonso brought Vettel and Button on to their tail, and the Ferrari lost out, its front wing damaged on the back of Vettel's car, in a no-holds-barred four-way fight in the closing laps.Alonso ended up eighth, behind Vettel, Magnussen and Button.Magnussen was later handed a 20-second penalty and two driver penalty points for crowding Alonso off the circuit during the battle, which promoted Force India's Nico Hulkenberg to 10th, behind team-mate Sergio Perez and Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat.Full race resultsBelgian Grand Prix coverage details",

But the results have been disappointing and earlier this summer Iraq's forces suffered another blow with the loss of the western city of Ramadi.Many British officers were dismayed that the government would commit only a few dozen personnel to the effort to retrain Kurdish and Iraqi forces - fewer than Australia, Canada, Italy and Spain.Lt Gen Mayall argues also that the model was wrong, with the foreign advisers not willing to lead the newly trained units into battle, something that could have, \"massively increased\" British leverage at a time when Iran was getting more involved in that battle. \"If we genuinely want to stop this and reverse it,\" he says of Islamic State's advance, \"we are going to have to do more than have high-flown rhetoric because this is a really seriously dangerous situation on the ground\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and our response frankly is inadequate for the scale of the problem that we've got. \"As for plans for UK forces to take part in the setting up of a safe area and no-fly zone in Syria, Russia's actions are causing them to be reassessed. \"It's very difficult for Britain to do it independently,\" he believes. \"A bigger question is does the United States aspire to a meaningful role out there and it may be that the Russian intervention is something that genuinely at last forces some really clear thinking. \"More on this story from Mark Urban on BBC Newsnight at 22:30 BST BBC Two on Friday 2 October, and afterwards on iPlayer",

        "text": "All of this can make breathing difficult.Previous studies have shown a link between repeated lung infections with RSV and developing asthma later in life.One Swedish study showed showed 39% of infants taken to hospital with RSV had asthma when they were 18. However, only 9% of infants who were not ill developed asthma.How the virus might be able to do this was, however, unknown. Now a team of researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine believe they have an explanation.Their experiments on mice showed the virus impaired the ability of a specific part of the immune system, called regulatory T cells, to calm inflammation.Inflammation is an important part of dealing with an infection. However, for asthma patients, chemicals in air which come from ordinary things like dust mites, pets and mould can trigger an inappropriate inflammatory response.Infection with RSV led to a \"complete loss of suppressive function\" of the regulatory T cells, after which the mice developed asthma-like symptoms,\" researchers Prof Anuradha Ray and Prof Prabir Ray told the BBC.They said there might be a window in early life when the cells were vulnerable to being \"crippled\".They think the finding could help scientists devise treatments which prevent some people developing asthma. \"We feel that both prophylactic and therapeutic approaches can be developed. \"This is especially desirable in infants who have a strong family history of asthma. \"Malayka Rahman, from Asthma UK, said: \"This research provides vital information on how viruses interact with our immune cells and why this might lead to an increased risk of asthma. \"What's really exciting is the potential of these findings to translate into new treatments for asthma in the future.\"",

The study suggests that this may be a key factor in the development of asthma in early childhood.Dr. Danuta Radzioch, lead author of the study, said: \"Our research shows that RSV infection can have a long-lasting impact on the immune system, making it more likely for children to develop asthma.

This year, 160 officers will be recruited and the force had been \"inundated\" with applications, he said.But, with more money needed to be saved by 2020, Mr Farrar said police needed to work in different ways to ensure they were as efficient and effective as possible.He said detective work was benefitting from computers. Surveillance work that involves physically following a suspect might take a week - but the same checks can now often be carried out online because people post so much on social media, he said. \"The reality is a lot of the job we do, if it doesn't contain emotion then we can probably do it by way of a computer. \"So a lot of the things that we may be able to do in the future though artificial intelligence might be things that ordinarily would have been done by people. \"Mr Farrar pointed out the usefulness of drones in the case of the body of a woman murdered 20 years ago being found at Wentwood Reservoir, near Newport. \"We couldn't have done that by foot and conventional means,\" said Mr Farrar, speaking as Gwent Police celebrated its 50th anniversary. \"We put a drone up in the air, the drone was right above the scene and I had in my office perfect HD quality pictures of the scene. We could never have done that [without the drone]. \"I actually think in years to come, and it's not that far off, we will have one of those drones in the back of every police vehicle so we will be able to deploy those all the time. \"Earlier this year, Gwent became the second force in Wales after South Wales Police to gain permission from the Civil Aviation Authority to use the drones - or unmanned aircrafts - to help search for missing people, tackle anti-social behaviour and other operations.In addition, police officers now have body cams to record incidents and hand-held devices which can quickly carry out checks on vehicles and criminal records.Back at police headquarters in Cwmbran, Mr Farrar has an app he can use to look at any officer's pocket book in real time if he needs any information.But, ultimately, he said computers would never fully replace the role of police officers. \"The public still like to see a police officer as it's reassuring.\"",

Currently, police officers spend countless hours reviewing footage to identify suspects and gather evidence. With AI, this process could be automated, freeing up officers to focus on more critical tasks.Farrar also believes that technology can help improve community engagement and trust. \"We can use social media and other digital platforms to communicate more effectively with the public,\" he said. \"We can provide real-time updates on incidents, and engage with people in a more meaningful way.\"Despite the potential benefits, there are also concerns about the impact of technology on policing. Some critics argue that an over-reliance on technology could lead to a loss of human judgment and empathy. Others worry about the potential for bias in AI systems, which could perpetuate existing social inequalities.Farrar acknowledges these concerns, but believes that they can be mitigated through careful planning and implementation. \"We need to make sure that we're using technology in a way that complements human judgment, rather than replacing it,\" he said. \"And we need to ensure that our systems are transparent, accountable, and free from bias.\"As Gwent Police continues to navigate the challenges of budget cuts and technological change, Farrar's vision for a more innovative and efficient police force is likely to be closely watched. While there are many uncertainties ahead, one thing is clear: the future of policing will be shaped by technology, and those who adapt quickly will be best placed to succeed.In related news, the Gwent Police and Crime Commissioner, Ian Johnston, has announced plans to hold a public consultation on the use of drones and AI in policing. The consultation, which will take place over the next three months, will seek to gather views from the public on the potential benefits and risks of these technologies.Johnston said, \"We want to hear from the public about their concerns and ideas on how we can use technology to improve policing. This is an important opportunity for us to engage with the community and ensure that our use of technology is transparent, accountable, and in the best interests of the public.\"The consultation will be held online and in person, with a series of public meetings and focus groups taking place across the region. The results of the consultation will be published later this year, and will inform the development of Gwent Police's technology strategy.",

The party is trying to show that it still has mass appeal, and can compete with other opposition politicians such as Imran Khan. It is, after all, a party that has fought military dictatorships in Pakistan time and again over the last four decades.But in the end, the rally was seen as a government-sponsored event, because the party still governs the southern province of Sindh.

        "text": "He stripped away the remaining parts of what had been Scottish Media Group.The company has stopped harking back to its launch, 60 years ago, when Scottish Television was described by its founding chairman as as \"a licence to print money\".It had to become less of a couthy institution.With the fracturing multi-channel TV audience, a commercial Scottish channel carrying its regulatory requirements seemed like it would be buried by BBC competition, dependence on ITV content, the arrival of more nimble commercial competition, and a financial crash that took down much of its advertising revenue.It has not been an easy path. The relationship with ITV went badly wrong for a while. Woodward gambled on refusing to take expensive ITV drama, and had to admit defeat.The demise of police drama Taggart as a money-earner has yet to be replaced. The drive towards becoming an independent producer for other channels has been bumpy and fallen short of expectations.But STV has survived, and is in fairly robust health - the only part of the channel 3 network that is independent of ITV.It has refocused on its online news and entertainment, learning quickly that the plan to go hyper-local with hundreds of parish pump news sites was not going to work, and changing tack.Its video-on-demand is growing by 23% in the first five months of this year.Scotland Tonight has been a notable success, seeing off its BBC rival in the same time slot.And Woodward has taken the opportunity of new licences for local TV, deftly turning them from city stations into a new national network, and beating the BBC to an integrated TV news programme.STV2, launched on Monday, may not be quite the spirit intended when the licences were handed out. It may not have much of a budget. But so far, it's been proving a smarter business than others who won the right to give local TV a try.Ten years is often seen as an appropriate time for a chief executive to move on, for reasons of good governance.But one other reason why Mr Woodward may be thinking of getting out of his Clydeside office is the appearance among his shareholders of an investment fund called Crystal Amber.It has just raised its stake to 14% of STV shares. That's in addition to 21% of shares in Johnston Press.Why? Richard Bernstein, who runs the fund from London and Guernsey, isn't saying. But Crystal Amber is an activist investor.As Ashley Highfield is finding at Johnston Press in Edinburgh, its interest in a stock may help support the price, but it can also be a warning of turbulence ahead.",

She is a smaller panda, she likes to spend a lot of time away from the keepers. \"Yang Guang is a big ray of sunshine. He's a huge panda, really impressive. \"He spent a lot of time eating last night and seemed really happy as he was scent-marking his enclosure to say this is my territory. \"He is a big gregarious panda so I know he is going to be really popular with the visitors. \"The pandas' new \u00c2\u00a3250,000 home at the zoo includes two separate enclosures.When Tian Tian comes into season the pair will be introduced to each other - possibly in February or March.Tian Tian has had twin cubs in the past, and Yang Guang has also fathered cubs - though not as a pair together.Animal welfare campaigners have criticised the zoo for accepting the pandas, saying it is a \"primarily commercial deal\".They claim it is not a credible way to go about saving the giant panda.Bringing the pandas to Edinburgh has involved a five-year effort by the zoo.The eight-year-old pair will stay at the zoo for at least 10 years.First Minister Alex Salmond thanked Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang for the \"generous gift\" of the pandas when they met on Monday during his visit to China.The meeting in Beijing looked at how to build on the business and cultural links already established between the two countries.",

Our experts don't think it is viable. \"If they can get the evidence to say it is safe, if they can show people it is a good, viable entity, then I'm sure we'll pass it. \"\"We are in difficult times. National security, having our own energy is key. Geothermal in Cheshire East yes. If fracking works elsewhere and it is safe, I'm for it. But let it be safe. \"Mr Corcoran said: \"The problem is with the bombastic style of the statement made last year. It was a promise that was never in the power of Councillor Michael Jones to keep. \"So the current U-turn comes as no surprise to me. \"Cheshire East will remain \"fracking free\", said the council in January last year. Leader Michael Jones told residents he was committed to exploiting much less controversial reserves of geothermal energy instead.That caused problems though as councils are legally obliged to consider any planning application on its merits.Today's dispute comes down to a battle of research - with Mr Jones claiming his research shows fracking just won't be viable in many parts of his borough.But there does appear to have been one major concession made - Mr Jones said if fracking can be proven to be safe \"then I'm sure we'll pass it\".Mr Corcoran agreed that the onus should be on those who want to frack to prove that it is safe.He claimed government pressure meant instead that \"local authorities have to prove it is dangerous before they reject planning applications\".In June, Lancashire County Council refused permission for Cuadrilla to frack at two sites. The company is appealing against the decision.Ministers recently announced plans to fast-track fracking applications, saying they could take over the power to decide if councils repeatedly take longer than the 16-week statutory timeframe to evaluate plans.",

Tunisia's beaches were a top destination for European tourists.But unemployment among a swelling population of young people remained high, and large sections of the Tunisian interior remained poor.In the style of many Arab rulers, Ben Ali's face became a constant presence in Tunisia, with giant posters of the president visible in public spaces across the country.Political protest was not tolerated and human rights groups accused Ben Ali's regime of unfairly arresting and mistreating political dissidents.Under the surface, there was resentment against the perceived corruption surrounding the ruling elite, some of which was detailed in US diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks at the end of 2010.Ben Ali was married twice with six children. His second wife, Leila Trabelsi, played a prominent role in Tunisian public life and reportedly helped amass huge economic holdings for her extended family.With no obvious rivals to Ben Ali, there was speculation that he was looking to pass on power to one of his relatives.In the final days of 2010, a series of protests began in the centre of the country after a young graduate set himself on fire when stopped from selling fruit and vegetables without a licence.The protests, advertised widely through social media networks, gradually spread.Ben Ali initially blamed the demonstrations on a fringe of \"extremists\". But he changed tack on 13 January, expressing deep regrets for the deaths of protesters, pledging to introduce media freedoms, and promising not to stand in 2014.But his offer of concessions failed to quell the unrest, and the following day, after huge crowds took to the streets of Tunis and clashed with the security forces once again, he fled the country.",

However, a spokesperson said that the safety of the public is the top priority and that all decisions regarding parole are made with the utmost care and consideration.As the case continues to unfold, Mrs. Fergus remains resolute in her determination to see justice served for her son. \"I will not rest until Venables is behind bars for good,\" she said. \"I owe it to James to keep fighting for him.\" The news of Venables' latest arrest has sent shockwaves throughout the community, with many calling for a complete overhaul of the parole system. \"This is a clear example of a system that is failing to protect the public,\" said a local resident. \"How can someone like Venables, who has a history of heinous crimes, be allowed to roam free and continue to offend?\"The case has also sparked a wider debate about the rehabilitation of high-risk offenders and the effectiveness of treatment programs. \"It's clear that Venables has not been rehabilitated and is still a danger to society,\" said a criminologist."

The figures vary widely between authorities, with some councils having no children placed outside of Wales, while others have multiple cases.Action for Children, a charity that works with vulnerable children and young people, has expressed concern about the impact of out-of-area placements on children's well-being. \"It's not just about the distance, it's about the sense of disconnection and isolation that these children can feel,\" said Ms. Welham.The charity is calling for more foster carers to come forward, particularly in areas where there is a shortage of placements. \"We need more people to consider becoming foster carers, so that we can provide stable and loving homes for these children,\" said Ms. Welham.The Welsh Government has also responded to the issue, stating that it is working to increase the number of foster carers in Wales and to improve the support available to children in care. \"We recognize the importance of providing stable and nurturing environments for children in care, and we are committed to ensuring that they receive the support they need to thrive,\" said a spokesperson.However, critics argue that more needs to be done to address the root causes of the problem. \"We need to look at why these children are ending up in care in the first place, and what we can do to support families to stay together,\" said one social worker.As the debate continues, one thing is clear: the issue of out-of-area placements is a complex and multifaceted one, and it will require a concerted effort from all parties involved to find a solution that puts the needs of children first."

I have no injuries or ailments. \"The car, a 2015 model modified to simulate 2017 downforce levels, was too damaged to continue with the test.That meant the plan for Ferrari reserve driver Antonio Giovinazzi to have his first taste of an F1 car on Friday had to be called off.The Pirelli spokesman said the company was evaluating potential technologies aimed at the 2018 season, including new tread patterns and rubber compounds.Vettel's crash was on his first lap out of the pits after a break for lunch. The weather was cold - the temperature was 4C - and it has been suggested that a lack of temperature in the tyres could well have been a contributing factor.F1 tyres have to be at the right temperature to operate effectively and the temperature in Maranello on Thursday was in the region of 10C cooler than F1 cars would ever normally encounter at even the coolest Grand Prix.The Pirelli spokesman also said that one of the technologies the company was trying that day were tyres that operate without the use of the heating blankets that have been used in F1 for many years to ensure they are at close to operating temperature as possible when they leave the pits.Pirelli has modified its wet-weather tyres for the 2017 season in response to widespread criticism from drivers of the 'extreme' tyre, which is used in the worst conditions.Vettel described the tyre at last year's British Grand Prix as \"basically just good enough to follow the safety car\", adding that \"no-one really has any trust in it\".The issue arose again following a number of crashes during the soaking race in Brazil in November.The problems have led to F1 giving Pirelli more test days to try out tyre developments. One of the eight pre-season test days in Barcelona at the end of this month and the beginning of March has been dedicated to this.",

        "text": "What actually happened that night has been intensely debated ever since.The 17-year-old high school junior lived in Miami.His parents divorced in 1999, and Martin lived with his mother. He had played youth football.According to a family member, Martin studied aviation through a part-time school programme, hoping to fly or become an engineer.In the week before his death he was on suspension from school for reportedly possessing a plastic bag with traces of marijuana. His father, Tracy Martin, told USA Today he hoped a short stay in Sanford, Florida, would teach his son a lesson.Martin also tweeted, changing his username at least once and writing thousands of tweets about his high school, sex and his favourite snacks.Friends and teachers at Michael D Krop Senior High described him as a \"funny guy\" and \"very creative\".Without ID on him at the time of the shooting, Martin was labelled as a \"John Doe\" by Sanford police and at the morgue until his father reported him missing.George Zimmerman, 29, the son of a white father and Hispanic mother, was born in Virginia and moved to Sanford in 2009 with his wife.Mr Zimmerman had asked a neighbour in Virginia for a recommendation letter to a police academy programme, but never applied.Records show he had previously worked at a car dealership and sold insurance, but what he was doing at the time of the shooting is unclear. A defence witness has said Mr Zimmerman was in the process of starting a business.He also attended a citizen's police academy with the Seminole Sheriff's Office.A spokeswoman described the once-a-week scheme that totalled 14 hours as an educational tool to teach residents about police work, not a training programme.In 2005, Mr Zimmerman was arrested for shoving a state alcohol agency officer near a bar.The charge was later dropped when he agreed to fulfil a \"pre-trial diversion\" programme for first-time offenders, which usually involves fines and anger management classes.Shortly after, a girlfriend took out a restraining order, following an argument where each accused the other of being the aggressor.Mr Zimmerman possessed a concealed-carry permit for a 9mm handgun.As a neighbourhood watch volunteer, he had called Sanford's police department 46 times over the previous eight years. A friend told the court he had taught Mr Zimmerman firearm safety.According to neighbours, Mr Zimmerman organised the neighbourhood watch during a rash of burglaries in the community.One neighbour said the 29-year-old had caught a thief while patrolling the neighbourhood.",

He called the police to report a \"suspicious person\" in the area, describing Martin as a black male wearing a hoodie. Despite being told by the dispatcher to stay in his vehicle and not to approach the individual, Zimmerman got out of his car and began to follow Martin on foot.What happened next is still a matter of dispute, but it is known that Zimmerman and Martin had a physical altercation, which ended with Zimmerman shooting Martin in the chest. Martin died shortly thereafter, and Zimmerman was left standing, claiming self-defense.The incident sparked widespread outrage and protests across the country, with many calling for Zimmerman's arrest and prosecution. The case drew national attention, with civil rights leaders and celebrities weighing in on the matter.

The wider it is the more money a bank makes.Co-op's is still a relatively modest 1.32%. That compares with Lloyds, which is expected to hit 2.6% by the end of the year.Generally, mortgages are a more profitable line of business for banks compared with savings products.And the mortgage market is brutally competitive at the moment, as the major banks battle for home buyers' custom.So interest rates charged to borrowers are under intense pressure to remain as low as possible.Which could be bad news for savers, if a bank wants to keep that margin improvement.Of course, this is all a balancing act. Depositors are important for a bank's capital position - so irritate them at your peril.Certainly, Mr Booker will be pleased that the Co-op has arrested the fall in current account holders.In the same period last year, Co-op lost over 60,000 customers.

The mom-and-pop shops are replaced by chain stores, and the people who have lived there for generations can no longer afford to stay.\"Dr. Lang called on city officials to ensure that the Metro is designed with the needs of local communities in mind, and that measures are put in place to protect and support small businesses and long-time residents.\"This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to get it right,\" he said. \"Let's make sure that the Metro is a tool for building stronger, more resilient communities, rather than a catalyst for gentrification and displacement.\"The concerns raised by Dr. Lang come as the city prepares to break ground on the Metro project, which is expected to take several years to complete. City officials have promised that the Metro will bring numerous benefits to the community, including reduced traffic congestion, improved air quality, and increased economic growth.However, critics argue that these benefits will only be realized if the project is carefully planned and executed with the needs of local communities at its core.As the debate over the Metro continues, one thing is clear: the fate of the city's neighborhoods hangs in the balance. Will the Metro be a force for good, or a catalyst for gentrification and displacement? Only time will tell. As the city moves forward with the Metro project, residents and business owners are holding their breath, waiting to see if their concerns will be addressed. Dr. Lang's warnings have struck a chord with many, who fear that the influx of new development and investment will price them out of their own neighborhoods.\"I've lived in this community my whole life,\" said Maria Sanchez, owner of a small bakery on Main Street. \"I've seen so many changes over the years, but this Metro project has me worried. I don't want to see our neighborhood become unrecognizable, with chain stores and high-rise apartments pushing out the small businesses and families that make this community special.\"Sanchez's concerns are echoed by many of her neighbors, who are calling on city officials to take a more nuanced approach to the Metro project."

        "text": "According to STL prosecutors, Elias Fouad Saab was a known alias of Mr Badreddine.Badreddine is subsequently believed to have facilitated attacks against the Israeli military and, after the US-led invasion in 2003, American and British troops in Iraq.He is also alleged to have taken \"overall control\" of the suicide car bomb attack that killed Rafik Hariri and 21 others in Beirut in February 2005.The STL indictment, issued in 2011, says analysis of mobile phone records shows that between 1 January 2005 and 14 February 2005, Badreddine was in contact 59 times with Salim Jamil Ayyash, a fellow defendant who prosecutors say co-ordinated the assassination team.Badreddine is alleged to have issued the final authorisation for the attack just under an hour before it happened, having earlier spoken by phone with Mughniyeh.STL prosecutors also revealed that there were almost no official records relating to Badreddine, who they said passed \"as an unrecognisable and untraceable ghost throughout Lebanon, leaving no footprint\".The prosecutors said Badreddine achieved this by using pseudonyms, as he appeared to do in Kuwait. While planning the bombing, they alleged, he presented himself as Sami Issa - the registered owner of three jewellery shops, an apartment in Jounieh and a motor boat, who said he was from a Christian village.Hezbollah has denied any involvement in the Hariri assassination.After Mughniyeh was killed in a car bombing in Damascus in 2008 - reportedly the result of a joint operation by Israel's Mossad spy agency and the US Central Intelligence Agency - Badreddine is believed to have taken over most of his duties as commander of Hezbollah's military wing.Badreddine was himself targeted for assassination in January 2015, when a suspected Israeli air strike in the Syrian Golan Heights killed six Hezbollah fighters, including Mughniyeh's son Jihad and an Iranian Revolutionary Guards general, the New York Times reported, citing an intelligence operative in the region. Badreddine had dropped out of the gathering at the last minute, it said.His death was initially blamed on Israel, Hezbollah's chief enemy.But Hezbollah later said its commander had been killed in a bombardment carried out by Sunni extremists.

        "text": "\"It is nerve-wracking,\" one said to me, perhaps euphemistically.Here is the ecstasy and agony of what could happen next week.If Greeks vote \"Yes\" to the deal with creditors - pension cuts, VAT rises and all - just maybe the European Central Bank (ECB), whose governing council meets on Monday morning, will lift the ceiling a fraction on the provision of Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA).That might not permit banks to start operating as normal with immediate effect. But it could allow the 60-euro daily ceiling on withdrawals to be raised a bit and the total freeze on transfers abroad to be eased somewhat.And that might allow the Greek economy to be taken out of the deep freeze it has been in since banks were ordered to more-or-less close last Monday.But if Greeks vote \"No\", as the government wishes them to do, there would be zero chance of the ECB turning on the ELA tap again.And as I said a few days ago, a \"No\" vote might persuade the ECB to demand additional collateral from banks to cover the risk of losses on the 120bn euros in emergency lending it and the Bank of Greece have already provided.This would be very painful for the banks. Right now they have unencumbered assets sufficient to borrow an additional 17bn to 20bn euros from the Bank of Greece, if the ELA ceiling were lifted.But if the ECB decided these assets - such as loans to Greek companies - are intrinsically less valuable than it currently thinks, and imposed a bigger so-called haircut on these loans, that 17bn to 20bn of possible additional credit could shrink to zero or a negative number.Or to put this more clearly, rather than lending to banks, the Bank of Greece and ECB could start to demand some of their outstanding credit back. Which none of the banks are in any position to give.Greek banks would go from their current frozen state to totally and utterly crippled. Which would dash any chance of them providing the fuel to re-start the Greek economy.And that would create a vicious cycle of more of the loans they've made to businesses and households going bad. Which in turn would wreak further damage on the banks.So there is a heavy responsibility both on Greek voters and then the European Central Bank over the next 48 hours. They will decide whether the Greek financial system and Greek economy stands or falls.",

The targets to reach that are: a 0.25% deficit this year, 0.5% surplus in 2016 and 1.75% surplus in 2017.Those targets are tough - but not as tough as originally envisaged, because the Greek economy is expected to shrink by 2.3% this year. It has spent most of the past seven years in recession.Greek economy returns to growthWhat about the banks?Greece's banks remain in a fragile state - they depend on emergency ECB funding and cannot borrow in capital markets.Strict capital controls remain in force - Greeks are limited to withdrawing \u20ac420 a week from their accounts.The banks were closed for three weeks in June-July, to prevent a bank run by anxious customers, who feared economic meltdown and \"Grexit\" - exit from the euro. The controls put a severe brake on economic activity.Under the new bailout terms, Greek banks are getting \u20ac10bn, aimed at recapitalising them by the end of the year.",

However, critics point out that delays in treatment could have devastating consequences, even for non-urgent cases.\"This is a dangerous and misguided policy that could put lives at risk,\" said Dr. Sophia Patel, a consultant at a nearby hospital. \"What happens if someone is unable to provide identification or proof of eligibility? Will they be turned away, even if they are in dire need of medical attention?\"Patient advocacy groups have also expressed concerns about the potential impact on vulnerable populations, such as refugees, asylum seekers, and undocumented migrants. \"These individuals often face significant barriers in accessing healthcare as it is,\" said Sarah Lee, director of the Migrant Health Network. \"Introducing identity checks will only exacerbate the problem and lead to further health inequalities.\"St George's has defended its proposal, citing the need to prioritize resources and ensure that NHS services are not abused. \"We have a duty to use our resources wisely and ensure that we are providing care and treatment to those who are eligible,\" said a hospital spokesperson. \"This is not about denying care to anyone, but about ensuring that we are targeting our resources effectively.\"However, critics argue that the proposal is misguided and that there are more effective ways to address health tourism. \"Rather than introducing bureaucratic barriers, we should be focusing on addressing the root causes of health tourism and ensuring that our healthcare system is adequately funded,\" said Dr. Patel.As the debate continues, it remains to be seen whether St George's will push ahead with its proposal. One thing is certain, however: the issue of identity checks in healthcare is a complex and contentious one that requires careful consideration and consultation with all stakeholders."

It [is] crucial to invest in 'not prison' - both instead of and after prison,\" she said.She also issued a warning over the number of inmates - one in six of the prison population - serving indeterminate sentences, saying they were a source of \"increasing volatility and potential disruption\". \"This is and will continue to be a significant upward driver of the prison population,\" she said.A Ministry of Justice spokesman said as part of the \"rehabilitation revolution\", the government was working towards providing a \"fit for purpose prison estate\" by building new prisons and closing \"inefficient and worn out places\". \"The government has announced its intention to conduct a full assessment of sentencing policy to ensure that it is effective in deterring crime, protecting the public, punishing offenders and cutting re-offending,\" he added.",

It was Labour where they were uniformly wrong. They also overestimated UKIP and the SNP.Survation were closest to the actual result. Kantar Public's numbers were also reasonably good.YouGov's final poll, like most of the others, seriously underestimated Labour. Prior to that, they had been suggesting a closer race. They also had a separate seat projection model which had been indicating a hung parliament. That had been met with a lot of scepticism but, with hindsight, was pretty accurate.In the final weeks of the campaign, the polls were often criticised for being \"all over the place\". It's true that they were pointing to very different outcomes.That variation clearly made it difficult to interpret what they were saying. It's surely better, though, that they had different numbers than that they were all wrong in exactly the same way. If you're looking for consistent accuracy then opinion polls are probably not for you.Pollsters are also sometimes accused of herding - deliberately manipulating their figures so they all say the same thing. That accusation can't be levelled at this election.In 2015 the polls went wrong because their samples were not representative of the electorate - they contained too many Labour voters. They also failed to estimate the difference in turnout rates between different age groups - they overestimated turnout among young voters.The pollsters who were furthest from the actual result this time were those, like ICM and ComRes, who had taken the strongest measures to try to rectify the problem from 2015. Survation made no significant changes to their methodology and came out on top.It looks as though the errors this time were caused, at least in part, by fighting the last war.We'll never know the exact figures for turnout among young voters - it's a secret ballot remember - but YouGov's post-election estimate puts it at 57% for 18-19 year olds and 59% for 20-24 year olds.That's lower than for older voters but considerably higher than estimates for young voters in 2015.We can also see that the places where the number of voters increased the most were generally those with young populations.

        "text": "\"A number of senior former officials in Hong Kong had written letters to the court in defence of Tsang's character.The judge said he took Tsang's reputation and long public service into account in sentencing, taking 10 months off what would have been a 30-month sentence. The maximum penalty could have been seven years.Tsang was cleared last week of a second count of misconduct, while the jury failed to reach a verdict on a third charge of accepting an advantage. He is expected to be retried on that charge in September.After sentencing, he was taken from court in handcuffs to the hospital where he has been staying since experiencing chest pain on Monday.When the presiding judge asked Mr Tsang to stand for sentencing, the former chief executive took a sip of water and closed his eyes. He kept his eyes closed during most of the sentencing speech and appeared to calm himself with a rhythmic breathing exercise.Five years of investigations and weeks of trial had culminated in this humiliating moment.It was an ignominious end for a man who used to be the pride of Hong Kong - someone who had overcome a humble start in life to hold three of the city's top jobs.Mr Tsang's legacy and reputation are in tatters and the judge acknowledged it, saying he had never before seen a man fall so far, so fast.The case has worried a territory that prides itself on its relatively clean reputation.The trial related to events which took place near the end of his term, between 2010 and 2012.Prosecutors accused Mr Tsang of inappropriate and undeclared conflicts of interest, including renting a luxury flat in mainland China from the shareholder of a broadcast company whose licence applications he approved. They also alleged the flat was redecorated free of charge and that he later nominated the interior designer for an honour.The jury found him guilty of misconduct over his failure to disclose the lease of the flat, but dismissed the charge related to the designer and did not reach a verdict on whether he accepted a bribe in the form of the refurbishment.A career civil servant, Tsang rose through the ranks to become Hong Kong's second chief executive, following Tung Chee-hwa.His deputy, former Chief Secretary Rafael Hui, was jailed for accepting bribes from a property tycoon in 2014.",

Tsang was accused of accepting a luxury apartment in Guangzhou, China, at a significantly discounted price, as well as other favors, in exchange for his support of the developer's business interests.During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence that Tsang had lied about his dealings with the developer and had concealed his ownership of the apartment from the public. The court heard that Tsang had also accepted other gifts and favors, including a luxury car and a trip to China, without disclosing them.Tsang's defense team had argued that the former chief executive was not guilty of misconduct, citing his long history of public service and his commitment to the people of Hong Kong. However, the judge rejected these arguments, saying that Tsang's actions were a clear breach of the public trust.The sentence is seen as a major blow to Tsang's reputation and a significant victory for anti-corruption efforts in Hong Kong. The territory has long been known for its clean government and strong institutions, and the conviction of a former chief executive is a rare and significant event.The case has also sparked widespread debate about corruption and accountability in Hong Kong, with many calling for greater transparency and stronger measures to prevent abuse of power.Tsang's legal team has indicated that they will appeal the sentence, but for now, the former chief executive will begin serving his prison term.",

He suggested that, if one of them was attacked, the US would be entitled to ask \"have they paid?\" before deciding to go to their assistance.The use of this language has caused alarm in many Nato capitals.There is also concern about suggestions that Mr Trump, as part of a rapprochement with Russia, might be prepared to concede a \"zone of influence\" to the Kremlin in former Soviet republics, or to reduce pressure over the issue of Ukraine. \"Ratifying the results of Russian aggression in Ukraine would buy you some short term stability,\" said Mr Vershbow, when asked about the possibility that Mr Trump might accept the Kremlin calling the shots in eastern Europe in return for better relations. \"But I think it would create a much more unstable situation in Europe, encourage the Russians to continue to press forward for some kind of Yalta 2 with a new division of Europe into spheres of influence, which I think would bring back some of the instability we saw in previous decades. \"Prior to his Nato role, Mr Vershbow was US ambassador to Moscow from 2001-2005.Acquiescing to further Russian operations in Ukraine (which is not a Nato member) might send a signal that the president-elect effectively recognises Russia's right to dominate certain neighbouring states, many Nato decision-makers feel.They fear also a possible knock-on effect in former Soviet republics that are now part of Nato (and indeed the European Union), the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. \"There must be absolutely no doubt about the imperative of defending and protecting Nato territory. There must be no discussion or deals about zones of influence, new Yaltas,\" says Gen Shirreff, \"because that strikes right at the heart of what Nato is about\".",

'I was told to watch The Big Bang Theory'. \"That's the level of training that we've got now in schools. \"Ms Haughney later said the issue of using cascading in lieu of direct training was \"really serious\", adding that \"if someone has bad practice, they are passing on bad practice\".Prof Sheila Riddell from the University of Edinburgh added that the training for children with additional support needs is \"very, very patchy in Scotland\".Mr Crawford said there needed to be \"creative thinking\" about training, amid \"huge challenges\" of upskilling a large workforce.He said the council worked with other organisations to deliver training, with online courses available too.He said: \"There are a range of developmental checklists, some of which are extremely useful in terms of child development. \"But what I wanted to say is I think there are also issues here in terms of initial teacher training, and the training that's offered at colleges to support staff, in terms of upskilling them before they go into the profession. It's not necessarily always down to local authority training once staff are in place. \"There's a stage before that which needs to be addressed as well in the preparation for going in to working with children and young people. \"Later in the session he added: \"We've focused a lot on training this morning, but what training?

Without that training, we're failing these children,\" she said.Colin Crawford, head of inclusion in the council's education services department, acknowledged that there may be a need to review the training provided to teachers, but suggested that this should start at the college level, rather than just focusing on in-service training. \"We need to ensure that our teachers are equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to support pupils with additional needs from the outset. This should be a fundamental part of their initial teacher training, rather than something that's tacked on later,\" he said.The education committee's inquiry into support for pupils with additional needs is ongoing, with further evidence to be heard in the coming weeks.

        "text": "The ability to contain a nuclear test would in itself be a big advance for the North.It also followed hard on the heels of a test of a missile with a long enough range to reach the US.Both were seen as an attempt by ailing leader Kim Jong-il to prove the North's nuclear capacity before he died.In the early hours of 12 February 2013, unusual seismic activity was again detected around Punggye-ri.The North said it had tested \"a miniaturised and lighter nuclear device with greater explosive force than previously\".The as-yet unproven reference to \"miniaturised\" stoked fears that Pyongyang was closer to producing a device small enough to fit on a long-range missile.Speculation was rife that the test involved a uranium device, though this has never been confirmed beyond doubt.A successful uranium test would mark a significant leap forward in North Korea's nuclear programme. The North's plutonium stocks are finite, but if it could enrich uranium it could build up a nuclear stockpile.Plutonium enrichment also has to happen in large, easy-to-spot facilities, whereas uranium enrichment can more easily be carried out in secrecy.The first indication was again report of an \"artificial quake\" in North Korea, registering about magnitude 5.1, close to Punggye-ri.North Korea later announced it had conducted its first successful test of a hydrogen bomb.H-bombs, also known as thermonuclear warheads, are massively more powerful than atomic bombs, using fusion - the merging of atoms - rather than fission to unleash enormous amounts of energy.Though again it has never been confirmed, that claim alarmed the international community.Observations from afar suggested the blast detected was not large enough to have been a full thermonuclear device, but may have involved some nuclear fusion.Again, North Korea said the device had been miniaturised.A few months later, Kim Jong-un announced that North Korea scientists had been able to do what had long been feared, and make a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on a warhead.It came after days of threats to carry out \"indiscriminate\" attacks on the US and South Korea.

He explained: \"We don't want people giving up taking their asthma treatment. \"He also warned against taking vitamin D without advice. \"Going to see your GP is a key part of the message we want to give - I don't think it would be appropriate to just start taking vitamin D without knowing whether you have vitamin D deficiency or not and we don't yet know what the threshold of vitamin D is below which you will have a benefit. \"Dr Rebecca Normansell, a GP from the Cochrane body, said asthma patients are not routinely tested for their vitamin D levels, but following further study \"it may be that that will be something that we should be considering as a reason to test vitamin D\". \"Talking with your pharmacist or GP is a great place to start as there may be other things that could be done for you as well to improve your asthma beyond thinking about your vitamin D,\" she said.Dr Imran Rafi, from the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), called the research \"encouraging\". \"However, more work still needs to be done in gathering the evidence, particularly around effectiveness for young people and children - especially as it currently affects as many as one in 11 children. \"He said he looked forward to seeing the results of further clinical trials to get a better understanding of this potential method of treatment. \"It is important to remember that not every drug is suitable for every patient and if a patient has asthma, they shouldn't make any changes to their medication without first discussing it with their family doctor.\"",

The two males will fight, which could result in the death of one of them,\" he told the BBC.Mr Moehring said the zoo would get six months' notice before the arrival of the female and its priority would be to find a new home for Marius.But he stressed that the move must not harm the carefully regulated genetic make-up of the giraffe population, otherwise Marius will have to be put down.And he defended the decision by Copenhagen to put down its Marius on Sunday. \"I am sure the zookeepers at Copenhagen had a really bad day on Sunday because they love those animals, but they knew it was the best solution for the giraffes there,\" Mr Moehring said.Copenhagen's scientific director, Bengt Holst, said Marius's genes were too similar to those of other animals in the European breeding programme, and he risked introducing rare and harmful genes to the giraffe population if he had been allowed to breed.Mr Holst also defended as scientifically educational his decision to allow visitors - including children - to watch the carcass being skinned, cut up and fed to the lions.His decision caused outrage among animal rights campaigners and has led to death threats against Mr Holst and his staff.The news about Jyllands Park's Marius has prompted an offer of a new home from an unexpected quarter, the leader of the Chechen Republic.Ramzan Kadyrov said in an Instagram post: \"On humanitarian grounds I am ready to take Marius.

        "text": "Since then, ERT has undergone several major overhauls to keep up with fierce private competition.These efforts were not entirely successful, and a fall in the company's ratings in the mid-1990s triggered a long-running debate about its cost and efficiency.Eighty per cent of the company's funding came from a licence fee included in electricity bills, and some of it was sourced from advertising revenue.Many Greeks objected to funding ERT through the licence fee, claiming that the company was too unpopular and too expensive. The broadcaster was also criticised for its openly pro-government reporting, especially since the start of the financial crisis in 2009.At the time of closing, ERT operated three main TV channels and more than a dozen national and local radio stations. ERT World TV catered for the Greek diaspora across the globe.The company's programming included news as well as factual and entertainment programmes. It claimed to broadcast more highbrow programmes - such as world cinema and documentaries - compared to the generally more light-hearted entertainment offered by its privately-owned rivals.The company's audience share in 2013 was relatively low at below 20%, with most Greeks preferring commercial broadcasters.The government's surprise decision to shut down ERT was, however, met with fierce criticism from the public. Even though most agreed that a restructuring and cost-savings were required at the company, its immediate closure was branded \"dictatorial\" by some.While most Greeks will continue getting their news and entertainment from private TV and radio stations, those in the east and some islands - where signal coverage is poor - may have to rely on Turkish broadcasters across the border.BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.
