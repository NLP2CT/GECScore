And with the hunger sometimes came sickness. Katiya saw too many of her tribe members fade away into nothing. She feared she would be the only one left. Every day, she would wake up with her father and watch him disappear into the darkness with the other tribesmen, desperate. And every evening, she would see the disappointment and despair etched onto their faces. Eventually, the world began to turn on them. Instead of being the hunters, they became the hunted. Beasts stalked them with new found confidence, waiting for the perfect time to pick them off -- finally high enough on the evolutionary ladder to take revenge. The first day they had come back one man short, the stares of the tribesmen were hollow and their clothes were painted in blood of their friend. After that, there would always be one or two less men with them when the returned. Instead of silently watch her father go into the unknown, Katiya began to cry and beg him not to leave. \"",

It was a definitive blow to the quality of killings when the police finally brought him to justice in 2008. The local scene has largely been lacking in noteworthy additions - there was brief hope when a series of hangings swept through the city, a rash of what appeared to be suicides at first but police later confirmed to be murders. The press went wild, and The Hangman ( a name I' m proud to have coined ) was briefly the darling of the local circuit. Sadly it was revealed not to be the work of a divinely inspired artist working on the human body, but merely a standard practice of the Dixie Mafia, who were inexplicably trying to muscle in. The gang war was long and bloody, but contained no repeat killings of particular interest so I largely stopped paying attention. Being a serial killer critic is hard work. Most of the time, I just sit here at my desk, flicking through police reports.",

I had come to the conclusion that the last piece of the equation I needed was something related to fractals. Pure symmetry in nature, like a glimpse into the inner workings of space and time. All I needed was the constant. All I needed was… All that I… my mind gave up. I slept. I dreamt that I was eaten lizard-like creature. We were face to face, though I felt no fear. His blazing eyes seemed to stare into my soul as he opened his moth. The creature then swallowed me whole, and I fell into the pit of his stomach. As I faced my impending doom, I noticed the ringlets that surrounded the inner lining of his abdomen. The circular shapes seemed to grow, becoming three dimensional and surrounding me in a flash of light. Next thing I knew I was awake and writing. “ Of course! ” I said aloud as my hand scribbled rapidly. The constant was pi; the ratio of a circle' s circumference to its diameter. A wave of joy had given me new energy.",

With a heave, and a good pull, I haul myself over the edge onto the plateau, and there he is. His hat is pulled low, I ca n' t see his eyes. He is just standing there. It' s as if time stopped. Nothing exists except him and I sizing each other up wordlessly. The lighting flashes again, and the rain assaults our forms. Finally, slowly and with what seemed to be a final precision, he reaches for a pokeball. There were no words exchanged. We knew why the other was there.",

A high pitched alarm sounded somewhere in the room. “ Get down! ” The paramedic shouted tackling Henry into the hallway. # BA-DA-DOOOOOOM! ! ! ! The explosion rocked the building sending fire through the windows. Henry felt the heat as shattered glass rained down upon him, lacerating his arms and legs. The armored paramedic lay heavy on top of Henry as smoke and fire filled the air. He looked back at the inferno that once was his wife as tears filled his eyes. “ It ’ s okay Henry, ” the paramedic assured, “ she ’ s with the angels now.",

Thirteen years they had been together, Although Sam never found it ironic that the divorce came then. It was n' t unlucky for her, it was how things had to be. Her boyfriend, Derek, never asked much about her old life.

I peered around my cul de sac and at the few houses that sat aligned next to mine, forming a quaint little half-moon around the street. The fences were worn and the grass was bruised and yellow. Car horns and whisking city air filled the sky. Not too appealing. .. I heard a door open and turned to see a large male wearing purple pants, purple shoes, purple shirt, and a purple hat. \" You' ve got a good taste in color! \" I said with a cheerful smile. The man cocked an eyebrow and did n' t move from his doorstep. \" I just moved in next door. My name is Jaerin. \" \" Damn. \"",

Most parents in this day and age monitor what their children read very strictly, since it ’ s common knowledge that one story a kid reads ends up coming true for them in the future. Generally, it ’ s all planned out. Sadly, my parents decided that wasn ’ t how they were going to raise me, which I guess is fair. Both of them were writers, so I got to read whatever drafts, manuscripts, or chapters they churned out, along with the authors they were inspired by. In theory, I could get just about any result out of this; from Poe ’ s “ The Fall of the House of Usher, ” to “ Green Eggs and Ham, ” or even get a sappy love story like “ The Fault in Our Stars.",

A streetlamp further down the street was struggling against the serenity of the dark; it flickered weakly against the tide of darkness, almost pointlessly, I thought. These midnight walks were, beyond all else, peaceful. Silence and darkness seem to be companions, but I find myself fonder of darkness over silence. A crow cawed somewhere. The sound carried endlessly, given no distractions or disturbances. Eventually, it faded into nothing. I took a detour toward the oval, stepping lightly on the soft, wet grass, and making my movements as deliberate as possible. When I reached what I imagined to be the centre, I sat down.

With the last of his dwindling energy he rips the body apart and casts the pieces into the dense jungle. Survivor enters the clearing where the battle just took place to survey the carnage.

Well, guess this is just another mistake to add to the list. Because apparently now the existence of God has been proven. Without a doubt. Why didn ’ t I go to church more? Why didn ’ t I pray? Was it really that much work to thank Him for my meals? Was it so hard to give Him my thanks when I did well? My selfish mind thought those things were all created by me, my peers, and things I could see. Tangible things. But now I find out I was wrong. That was the internal struggle I had going on. Rationalizations, memories, excuses. Also, who had the time to read, especially such long stories? I wasn ’ t a good reader, and frankly didn ’ t want to improve. I had TV, and that ’ s all I needed.",

As I watched them begin the injection on the inmate he looked across the crowd and stopped on me. He gazed deep into my eyes, I could almost feel him reach into me. He then said the last 3 words of his life, “ I forgive you. ” That moment stuck with me all my life but I never knew what it meant until now. I still remember it like it was yesterday but for him it is 3 years away. It was then that I knew what to do.

The enthusiasm surrounding time travel was palpable, yet tempered by the cautious understanding that playing with the fabric of time carried great responsibility.Regulatory bodies were established to control and manage the deployment of time travel technology. Strict guidelines governed the usage of time machines, ensuring the preservation of the timeline and minimizing any potential disruptions. Delicate balances were struck between research, exploration, and the preservation of historical integrity. However, as with any power, there were individuals and organizations seeking to exploit time travel for their own gain, adding intrigue and conflict to this brave new world.The impact of time travel rippled through society. Historians, previously limited to mere observations of the past, now had the means to experience and interact with history firsthand.",

Whether through rallies, speeches, or the relentless dissemination of propaganda, Hitler ensured that his message was omnipresent, seeping into the very fabric of German society.While it is crucial to acknowledge Adolf Hitler's intelligence and cunning, it is equally important to unreservedly condemn his actions and the unspeakable atrocities committed under his leadership.",

It seeped into every aspect of his existence, staining his relationships, his work, and even his own sense of self. He had lost count of the number of times he had let down his friends, frustrated his colleagues, and disappointed himself.Ironically, Robinson was acutely aware of the value of time. He understood its significance, its precious nature that once gone could never be reclaimed. He often marveled at the achievements of punctual individuals, envying their ability to bend time to their will. He longed to possess that skill, to be in control of his own existence.But despite his earnest efforts, Robinson found himself caught in a perpetual cycle of procrastination and distraction. Time slipped through his fingers like sand, leaving him disoriented and defeated. He tried every strategy he could think of: setting multiple alarms, meticulously planning his day, even resorting to desperate measures like arriving hours early to appointments.",

Robinson diligently followed each instruction, pouring his heart and soul into the process. Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months as he toiled to master the art of time manipulation.Finally, the moment of truth arrived—a starlit night when the cosmic energies were said to align with the ritual. Robinson stood at the center of an ancient stone circle, reciting the incantation he had painstakingly memorized. As his voice resonated through the night, a surge of energy coursed through his veins.Time itself seemed to pause, as if holding its breath, waiting for Robinson's command. In that suspended moment, he felt a profound sense of clarity and purpose. The burden of lateness lifted from his shoulders, replaced by a newfound determination to live fully in each moment.From that day forward, Robinson became the master of time. He no longer rushed through life, haunted by the fear of being late. Instead, he savored every moment, embracing the present with a deep gratitude.",

Nightmares began to creep into her subconscious, and the objects that materialized took on a sinister edge. Sinister dolls with piercing eyes and spectral figures that seemed to shimmer in the moonlight became a common occurrence. Fear gripped the town, and Willow brook was no longer the peaceful haven it once was.

Refusing help may safeguard our independence, but it also severs the threads that connect us to the fabric of humanity.

But what if, in its solitary grandeur, the oak refused to share its bounty with the surrounding ecosystem? The forest would suffer, and the oak itself would be diminished, lacking the vibrant tapestry of life that thrives under its sheltering branches. Similarly, when we isolate ourselves, refusing to accept assistance or provide it, we diminish the richness of our own experiences. We miss the opportunity to learn from the wisdom of others, to grow from their perspectives, and to forge bonds that enrich our souls. Refusing help can be a shield against vulnerability, but it also deprives us of the profound connections that make life truly meaningful.",

But one fateful night, as a storm raged outside, a desperate plea echoed through the rain-soaked air, stirring her spirit. The village's only healer lay gravely ill, and his cure rested in a legendary herb that blossomed only within the heart of a dark and enchanted forest.

Doubts clawed at her resolve, but a voice deep within her whispered words of encouragement. \"Face your fears, Elara,\" it echoed.",
