They are silent and kids can change the tension so if they feel they have more energy they can crank up the tension. \"Within a week some students started to say they thought they were focusing more and Ms Lambeth noticed that they were more engaged in conversation in class. \"They were able to recall a lot more of what I was saying and because they participated more they understood more and they did better in tests. \"As a result she says their test grades demonstrably improved from when the pedals were introduced in April compared to earlier in the school year.Other teachers using the same classroom have also noticed an improvement in students' grades and parents have reported that their children were more interested in just being in the class.The pedals cost $180 (Â£138) each and were bought with a grant from the local Wake County Public School System.Now the school is hoping to buy more pedals and extend the programme.Staff who work with youngsters on the behavioural support programme area are also interested in seeing if they can make a difference for them.By Annie Flury, UGC and Social News team.",

The unconventional approach has yielded surprising results - Lambeth reporting a significant improvement in her students' grades and overall behavior. The difference it made was amazed, says Lambeth. \"The children were able to channel their excess energy into a productive outlet and a result, they were able to focus more effectively during lesson lessons. \"The idea came to Lambeth after she observing the constant movement of her students during the class. \"They just could not sit still,\" she remembered. It would tap their feet, swing their legs, or turn and walk around the room. It was distracting for everyone, including themselves.\" Lambeth determined to find a solution began looking at alternative seating options and stumbled upon the concept of active sitting. By placing pedals under the desks, Lambeth created an opportunity for her students to engage in gentle exercise while still participating in lessons. The pedals allow students to pedal quietly, burning energy while seated and focused on the lesson at hand. The impact has been remarkable, with students reporting improved concentration and a sense of calm. During math lessons I used to get really unrestful, but now I can just pedal away and it helps me focus,\" said one student. Another student added, \"It's like my brain and my body are working together now. I feel more in control. The innovative approach of Lambeth has also sparked interest among her colleagues, with several teachers expressing interest in adopting similar strategies in their own classrooms. As word of the \"pedal desks\" spreads it's clear that Lambeth's creative solution has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about learning and student engagement. In an era where traditional teaching methods are challenged, Lambeth's experiment serves as a powerful reminder that sometimes it takes a little creativity and a little outside-the-box thinking to unlock the full potential of our students.",

The PP, led by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, won 123 seats down from 186 in the previous election, while the PSOE won 90 seats.The result reportedly left open the possibility of a coalition government with Podemos and Ciudadanos occupying the power balance. Mr. Iglesias has already begun discussions with the PSOE and other parties to form a new government, although the process is expected to be complex and potentially lengthy. The election was marked by a high turnout with over 73% of eligible voters voting. The result is seen as a rejection of the austerity measures of the PP Government, which has implemented harsh spending cuts and tax increases in response to the economic crisis.Podemos' success is also seen as a reflection of the growing disillusionment among young Spaniards who are disproportionately affected by the crisis. The promise of the party to tackle corruption, increase social spending and reform the political system resonated with many voters. The election result sent shockwaves through Europe where many countries are grappling with similar economic and political challenges. The rise of Podemos and other anti-austerity parties has raised concerns about the stability of the European Union and the future of the Eurozone.As Spain enters a new era of political uncertainty, one thing is clear: The traditional two-party system of the country is no longer in place and the future of Spanish politics will be shaped by the emergence of new forces and new ideas. The result of the election has also sparked worries about the potential impact on the Spanish economy, which has only recently begun showing signs of recovery after a prolonged recession. The austerity measures of the PP, although not popular, had been credited with helping to stabilize the economy and attract foreign investment.

Dr. Applebee stated that the regime causing \"unnecessary stress and anxiety\" among GPs and that the focus should be on providing high-quality patient care rather than \"jumping through hoops\" to meet inspection criteria. The Royal College of GPs (RCGP) also expressed concerns about the Inspection regime, with chair Dr. Maureen Baker saying that it was \"overly bureaucratic and not fit for purpose\". Dr. Baker argued that the regime did not take into account the unique challenges of general practice and that it was failing to recognize the good work done by many GPs. The Care Quality Commission (CQC), which is responsible for the inspection regime, defended its approach, saying that it was necessary to ensure that patients received safe and effective care. A spokesperson for CQC stated that the inspections were designed to identify areas for improvement and push up standards in general practice. However, many GPs disagreed, saying the inspections were too focused on paperwork and box-ticking, rather than on quality of care provided to patients. The GP from Leeds, Dr. Richard Vautrey, said the inspections were \"a massive distraction\" from real issues facing general practice such as work workload and funding. The vote of the BMA delegates is likely to add to the growing pressure on the government to reform the inspection system. The Department of Health has already announced a review of the CQC inspection regime, which is expected to report later this year. In the meantime, GPs are calling for a more proportionate and risk-based approach to inspections, which would focus on supporting practices to improve rather than simply rating them. \"We need to get back to what matters most - providing high-quality care to our patients, not just ticking boxes to meet inspection criteria.\"",

Michael Hogan, the Australian fast bowler, paced 64 wickets in a season he continued to impress with his pace and accuracy. Hogan's experience and manner proved invaluable to the Glamorgan attack and his partnership with van der Gugten was a major factor in the team's success.The veteran all-rounder chipped in with 43 wickets and also contributed with the bat with over 500 runs in the season. Wagg's versatility and ability to adapt to different situations made him a valuable asset to the team. Craig Meschede, the South African born seamer, completed the quartet of fast bowlers and took 35 wickets in a season that saw him continue to develop as a bowler. The ability of Meschede to generate pace and bounce made him a little bit of a remark for opposing batsmen and his performances will have given plenty of encouragement for the future Glamorgan coaching staff.The collective efforts of these four fast bowlers were instrumental in the Glamorgan success in 2016 and their performances will be crucial if the team is to build on their successes last season. Glamorgan will be looking to make a tough challenge for the upcoming season with a strong pace. As the new season approaches, Glamorgan's coaching staff will feel energised by the knowledge that they have a potent pace attack at their disposal. The quartet of van der Gugten, Hogan, Wagg and Meschede will be looking to build on their impressive performances of last season - and with some luck and some favorable weather conditions they could be a force to be reckoned with in the upcoming campaign.

I guess it's a nice thing to show at CES but for 'real people' it doesn't mean much now. \"Samsung's event also introduced new smart devices for the kitchen.They included a fridge-freezer featuring a compartment that can be switched between the the two states, and an oven that can cook two meals at different temperatures.",

The multi-view OLED display is interesting, but is not a new concept. We've seen similar technology before from Sony. \"The focus of Samsung on improving its smart TV offerings was also seen as a response to criticism that its current range of smart TVs are not user-friendly enough. The company has faced criticism that its smart TV interface is cluttered and difficult to navigate, making it hard for users to find and access the apps and services they want.To address this, Samsung announced that it would introduce a new Smart TV platform, which it claims will be easier to use and more intuitive. The platform will have a simplified interface and new search function that allows users to find content from various apps and services. Some analysts remain skeptical of Samsung's ability to make a significant impact in the smart TV market. \"Samsung has been talking for years about its smart TV ambitions, but it has still not managed to crack the code,\" said O'Donovan. Until it can deliver a seamless and intuitive user experience, it will struggle to make a dent in the market. Samsung remains committed to its vision of creating a connected home ecosystem where its TVs and other devices can seamlessly interact with each other and with the Internet despite these challenges. The company has announced plans to expand its range of connected devices, including refrigerators, air conditioning and washing machines, which can be controlled remotely via a smartphone app. As the battle for dominance in the smart TV market heats up, Samsung will need to continue to innovate and improve its offerings if it wants to stay ahead of the competition.

His decision to defect is also seen as a significant embarrassment to the North Korean government that has been trying to improve its international image in recent years.The news of Thae's defection sent shockwaves through the diplomatic community in London with many questioning how he was able to escape the watchful eyes of the North Korean authorities. It is believed that Thae's decision to defect was made possible by South Korean intelligence agencies that have been working to convince high-ranking North Korean officials to defect.Thae's defection is the most prominent defection of a North Korean diplomat in recent years and is likely to have significant consequences for the North Korean regime. The move is seen as a major blow to the legitimacy and credibility of the regime, and it may lead to more defections of high-ranking officials in the future.The South Korean government has so far refused to comment on the report but it is believed to have provided Thae with protection and assistance when he seeks asylum in a third country. The news of Thae's defection has been met with excitement and hope in South Korea, where many see it as a sign that the North Korean regime is beginning to crumble.As the news of Thae's defection continues to spread, the international community is watching with bated breath to see how the North Korean regime will respond.

I know that it is not easy, particularly when you don't get the results you want, but that's when you need to stick together and show your passion and loyalty. Peter Batov's comments come as Liverpool prepare for a crucial run of fixtures, including a trip to Old Trafford to take on Manchester United and a home clash with Arsenal. The Reds will be looking to bounce back from their recent defeats and get their season back on track. Rodgers has been boosted by news that striker Daniel Sturridge is scheduled to return to training next week after a lengthy layoff with a thigh injury. The England international's return could provide a timely boost to the Reds attacking options and help them to climb the Premier League table. Berbatovs words of encouragement come at a crucial time for Liverpool who have struggled to find consistency this season. The Reds have suffered back-to-back defeats to Newcastle and Chelsea leaving them in 10th place in the Premier League table. Berbatov believes that Rodgers has the capability to turn things around and get Liverpool back on track. \"Brendan has a clear vision for the team and he is trying to implement it,\" Berbatov said. He has a good squad, but they need to find their rhythm and regroup. I'm sure that with a bit of patience and support they'll start to get the results they want. \"Berbatov's comments will likely resonate with Liverpool fans, who have become increasingly frustrated with the team's performances this season.",

The practice that involves retailers checking boarding passes to identify eligible customers has been criticized for benefiting shops rather than reducing the costs for travelers. According to Treasury Minister David Gauke, the VAT relief was introduced to reduce prices for travelers, and not to provide a windfall gain to shops. Retailers have argued however that they simply follow government rules that allow them to claim back the VAT on purchases by passengers flying to non-EU countries. Boots, one of the retailers at the center of the controversy, has announced that it will no longer ask customers to show their boarding passes while it conducts a review of the situation. Dixons, another retailer implicated in the practice, has reminded staff that looking at boarding passes is a \"request\" and not mandatory. The news has sparked concerns among passengers who feel that they are unfairly targeted by retailers. \"It's outrageous that shops profit from a tax relief that is intended to benefit us,\" says Sarah Johnson, a frequent flyer. As I've never been asked to show my boarding pass at airport shops before, I had no idea that they were charging VAT relief on my purchases. \"The UK Ombudsman, Dean Dunham, expressed his frustration at the situation and stated that under current laws there is little he can do to address the problem. The controversy has raised questions about the effectiveness of the tax relief system and whether it is being exploited by retailers. The government was urged to review the system and ensure that it is benefited passengers, rather than shops.In the meantime, passengers flying to non-EU countries are advised to be aware of the practice and to ask retailers about their VAT-exempt policies before making a purchase.",

He's a good young player, has a bright future ahead of him but I don't pick my team around what the supporters sing at the games. \"It is the tactical nous O'Neill has displayed that has won him more admirers out in France.His bold decision to make five changes and switch his system for the game with Ukraine ultimately sent Northern Ireland through and club chairmen will have been impressed by the way his players were well-drilled to stop Robert Lewandowski and Gareth Bale.Despite recently signing a four-year deal with the team after delivering major tournament football for the first time in 30 years, a £750,000 release clause in O'Neill's contract would not be a huge deterrent to the bigger clubs in England and Scotland should they identify him as a potential manager. \"There's going to be people who are looking at him,\" said his captain Steven Davis. \"He has done a hell of job here with us. We've had unbelievable progression in the last couple of years.

The song, which was a group of Northern Irish fans, went viral quickly and was even adopted by fans of other teams, becoming a symbol of the joy and camaraderie of the Euros. Despite not playing a single minute in the tournament, the popularity of Grigg skyrocketed with fans and pundits alike singing his praises. It even became a hot topic of conversation on social media, with the hashtag #WillGriggsOnFire, globally trending. The song’s influence extended beyond football stadium with Grigg’s face appearing on t-shirts, posters and even a popular video game. The cult status of the Wigan forward was cemented and he remains a beloved figure in the French football culture to this day. In a recent interview, Grigg reflected on the surreal experience, saying: \"It was crazy... I was sitting home watching the games and suddenly my name is chanted all over France.

Voting is mandatory in Singapore, with few exemptions allowed.The PAP's main rival - the Workers' Party - ended up with six seats, less than the seven it held in the outgoing parliament. A number of smaller parties also ran.The PAP's success has been attributed to its widespread popularity among Singaporeans - who have seen their country rapidly evolve into a first-world economy - as well as its tight political control.But government stumbles in managing immigration and infrastructure, coupled with a greater desire by younger Singaporeans for political plurality, have led to gains by opposition parties over the years.If the last election was the PAP's nadir, then this one marked its return to glory.In 2011 it scored 60% of the vote share - a good showing by most counts, but it was the party's worst ever performance - thanks to public unhappiness over an influx of foreigners, a housing shortage, and transport breakdowns.It sought to resolve these problems, promised to listen to citizens more, and put in place slightly more generous social welfare policies. On Friday, voters rewarded the party with a bigger mandate.Lingering feel-good vibes from last month's jubilee celebrations, and a renewed sense of gratitude to PAP founder and revered leader Lee Kuan Yew, triggered by his death in March, no doubt also played a part in voters' decisions.The PAP's return to power was widely expected but its large margin was a surprise to many, not least to the main opposition Workers' Party (WP). It campaigned on a platform of providing an effective check on the PAP, but lost a constituency and saw its winning margins reduced in the few seats it retained.The results thus cement the PAP's long-running political dominance in Singapore and highlight the long slog ahead for those pushing for political plurality with an electorate which, for now, appears unconvinced of its merits.Read more: Singapore's elections explained in memes",

However, the overwhelming majority of the PAP means that it will continue to have a free hand in shaping the country's policies and direction. First Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who has been at the helm since 2004, praised the result as a \"strong mandate\" for his party. He thanked the voters for their support and pledged to continue working towards a better future for all Singaporeans in a televised address. The election saw a record 2.5 million voters cast their ballots, which was marked by a high turnout of 95%. The campaign of the PAP focused on its track record of economic growth and stability as well as plans to address pressing concerns like housing affordability and healthcare costs. Despite all efforts of the opposition, it struggled to make significant inroads against the well-oiled machine of the PAP. The Workers' Party, which had been seen as the most credible candidate, failed to make a breakthrough in several key constituencies. The result is likely to be seen as a vote of confidence in the leadership of the PAP and its vision for Singapore's future. Some analysts have expressed concerns that the lack of a strong opposition presence in parliament could lead to a lack of checks and balances on the government power. As the PAP celebrates its victory, attention will now turn to the challenges that lie ahead. With Singapore facing an uncertain economic outlook and a rapidly changing global landscape, the government will have to work hard to maintain the country's competitiveness and ensure that its citizens continue to enjoy a high standard of living. The victory of the PAP has also sparked concerns about the country's political diversity and the need for a more strong opposition presence in parliament. While the gains of the Workers' Party are a small step forward, many observers believe that a more vibrant opposition is essential to ensure that the government remains accountable to the needs of citizens and responsive to them. In the aftermath of the election, opposition leaders vowed to continue their efforts to provide a credible alternative to the PAP. Workers' Party Secretary-General Pritam Singh said that his party would continue to push for reforms and greater transparency in government and would work to hold the PAP accountable for its actions despite the challenges ahead. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has expressed confidence in his party's ability to navigate the complexities of the global economy and to address the concerns of Singaporeans.",

        "text": "According to Dr. Lee, \"We were intrigued by the fact that bubbles in stout beers seem to defy conventional wisdom of buoyancy, where objects less dense than the surrounding fluid should rise rather than sink. Researchers used a combination of computer simulations and laboratory experiments to investigate flow patterns in standard pint glass. They found that the curvilinear shape of the glass creates a circulation pattern in the liquid, with an upward flow at the center of the glass and a downward flow at the edges. This circulation pattern is responsible for transporting the bubbles towards the bottom of the glass. The simulations of the team showed that the shape of the glass is the key factor in creating this circulation pattern. \"We found that if you change the shape of glass, the flow pattern changes and the bubbles no longer sink,\" explained Dr. Benilov.To test their theory, the researchers conducted experiments with a specially designed glass with a modified shape. The findings of the study have implications not only for our understanding of fluid dynamics but also for the beer industry. The study for beer enthusiasts provides a simple test to verify the results of the researchers. Next time you drink a pint of stout, try tilting the glass slightly to disrupt the circulation pattern, Dr. Lee suggested. If the bubbles start rising instead of sinking, then you'll know that our theory is correct! The results of the study have been published on the Arxiv Server and are set to be published in a leading physics journal. The research team is now exploring other applications of their findings including the behavior of bubbles in other types of liquids and the design of more efficient mixing vessels.",

Nuclear threats are not a game,\" Mr Ban said.The US has urged China and Russia to apply pressure on Pyongyang to change its Yongbyon plans.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei called for restraint from all sides to resolve the \"complex and sensitive\" situation.Russia's foreign ministry, meanwhile, warned against escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula. \"The main objective is to avoid the forceful military scenario. It is not acceptable to use the situation there (on the Korean peninsula) to try to reach someone's specific military and political aims,\" said ministry spokesman Grigoriy Logvinov.By Kim GhattasBBC state department correspondentNorth Korea - a vexing problem for the USThe BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul says Yongbyon has provided the North with successful leverage in the past.The complex offers Pyongyang two ways of making nuclear bombs - a uranium enrichment facility, and a nuclear reactor, from which the spent fuel can be turned into plutonium.Restarting it gives the regime several cards to play: it secures more material for its nuclear programme, and also re-focuses world attention on how to stop it, our correspondent says.The reactor at Yongbyon - which was the source for plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons programme - was closed in July 2007 as part of a disarmament-for-aid deal.The cooling tower at the facility was later destroyed, but then the disarmament deal stalled.Part of the reason the agreement fell apart was because the US did not believe Pyongyang was fully disclosing all of its nuclear facilities - a suspicion later bolstered when North Korea unveiled a uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon to US scientist Siegfried Hecker in 2010.While it appeared to be for electricity generation purposes, Mr Hecker said the facility could be readily converted to produce highly-enriched uranium for bombs.In a November 2010 report following his visit to Yongbyon, Mr Hecker said that based on what he saw, he believed North Korea could \"resume all plutonium operations within approximately six months\" at Yongbyon if so inclined.",

The latest move of the North to delay the opening of the Kaesong industrial zone has raised concerns over the stability of the region and potential for further provocations. Mr. Kerry said that we are taking these measures to ensure that we are prepared for any eventuality. \"We strongly urge North Korea to refrain from further provocative actions and to return to the negotiating table. The Kaesong Industrial Zone, just north of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) that separates North from South Korea, is a key symbol of inter-Korean cooperation and a vital source of revenue for the North. The delay in its opening raised concerns about the potential economic impact on the North and stability of the region. In recent weeks, the United States and South Korea have conducted joint military exercises that were met with anger and defiance from Pyongyang. North Korea has threatened to attack the US and South Korea and has warned that it will not be bound by the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. The international community has condemned North Korea's actions, with the United Nations Security Council imposing tough sanctions on the country following its nuclear test. The European Union has also imposed its own sanctions, and Japan has announced that it will impose additional measures to restrict trade with the North.As the situation continues to unfold, the international community remains on high alert with many calling for a peaceful resolution of the crisis. However, with North Korea's actions becoming increasingly belligerent, it remains to be seen whether a diplomatic solution can be found. The deployment of missile destroyers is viewed as a significant escalation of US military presence in the region and is likely to be viewed by Pyongyang as a provocative move. The destroyers are equipped with advanced missile defence systems and are capable of intercepting and destroying ballistic missiles. The move comes as the United States and South Korea are involved in a series of joint military exercises to demonstrate their military capabilities and to deter North Korea from taking further provocative actions. The exercises, which include live-fire drills and amphibious landings, have been met with anger and defiance from Pyongyang, which has accused the US and South Korea of planning an invasion.

The US government must do more to ensure that the remaining prisoners are charged and fairly tried or released. '' The closing of Guantanamo Bay has been a contentious issue for years, with many arguing that it is a symbol of the US's flawed approach to counterterrorism. The prison has been criticized for its use of indefinite detention, torture and other human rights abuses. President Obama has faced significant opposition from Congress, especially from Republicans who argue that the prison is necessary to detain and interrogate terrorist suspects. With only a few months left in office, it remains to be seen whether President Obama will be able to honor his promise to close Guantanamo Bay. The latest transfer of prisoners suggests that the administration is committed to progressing on this issue despite obstacles. In the meantime, the fate of the remaining 61 prisoners at Guantanamo Bay remains uncertain. While some may be transferred to other countries, others could face trial or continue detention. The closure of the prison would be a significant milestone in the US counter-terrorism approach and would likely have vast implications for the country's relationships with its allies and for its reputation around the world.",

This will affect the budget for next season which will not help our challenging for European football. \"We are happy to pay the market price for use of this facility, along with the other users in the city, and we would urge council to start the work urgently. \"A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said: \"Elected members of the Health and Community Committee unanimously agreed to defer a decision to progress with the tender for the football stadium and 3G element of the council-owned Brandywell and Daisyfield Masterplan project. \"This is to allow for further consultation with the greyhound fraternity on proposals to ensure a new greyhound track is included in the plan. \"The matter will now come before members at next months meeting for consideration and decision.\"",

It would be a significant setback for the club, which has been eagerly awaiting the upgrade to its facilities. \"We were expecting to start the tendering process soon, but unfortunately the consultation project of the council slowed things down,\" O'Doherty said in a statement. \"If we do not get moving soon I fear that the project may be delayed until October, which would be a huge disappointment to all involved with the club. O'Doherty emphasized that the club had been working closely with the Council to get the project on track, but the delay has put a damper on their plans. The upgrade to the Brandywell Stadium is considered crucial for the development of Derry City FC, which is struggling to compete with other teams in the league. The new pitch and dog track are expected to improve the overall playing experience for the team and provide a better facility for the fans.The delay has also raised concerns about the impact it may have on the team performance in the upcoming season. With the current pitch and facilities in need of repair, the team may be at a disadvantage compared to other teams with better facilities.O' Doherty urged the council to speed up the consultation process and to get the tendering process started as soon as possible.

Second Half ends Bolton Wanderers 0, Oxford United 2.Oxford United's first away win since promotion from League Two was a hard-fought one but ultimately one deserved. The U dominated possession and created the better chances throughout the game, with Josh Maguire and Josh Thomas scoring the final nine minutes to seal the win. On the other hand, Bolton Wanderers will be disappointed with their performance. They failed to test the Oxford goalkeeper Simon Eastwood seriously, despite using six different strikers during the course of the match. The Trotters have now failed to score in their last four matches and have not won a match since Phil Parkinson was named manager of the month for August.The win lifts Oxford United to 12th in the League One table while Bolton Wanderers remain in 18th place. We dominated the game and created the better chances The young have worked hard and deserved the three points. “Bolton Wanderers manager Phil Parkinson, on the other hand, was left to rue his team's lack of creativity at the resulting goal. \"We didn't create enough chances and didn't test their goalkeeper enough. We need to work on our attacking play and get back to winning ways as soon as possible.\" The victory marks a significant milestone for Oxford United, who struggled to find their footing in League One since their promotion from League Two. The win is a testament to the team's growing confidence and cohesion, and Appleton's tactics seemed to pay off as his side controlled the pace of the game from start to finish.Following the recent slump for the Bolton Wanderers, the loss is a worrying sign. The team has failed to score in its last four matches, and their lack of creativity on the field of goal is becoming a major concern. Parkinson's men have gone six games without a win, and pressure is mounting on the manager to turn things around. The match itself was a tightly contested affair, with both teams creating chances in the early stages.",

The £1m race is one of the most iconic and popular horse races in the world with a rich history dating back to 1839. Bookmakers are predicting a massive day of betting with more than £50m expected to be wagered on the race. Many Clouds is currently the 8-1 favorite, followed closely by The Last Samuri and Silviniaco Conti. The race has been moved to a later time slot of 17:15 BST to avoid a clash with the football fixtures of the afternoon in an effort to increase the audience figures. The BBC will provide extensive coverage of the event, with a special Grand National programme scheduled at 13:15 BST.In a blow to the event, two-time winner Ruby Walsh was ruled out of the race after suffering a broken wrist during a fall on Friday. Walsh was originally to ride Sir Des Champs, but will now be replaced by jockey Andrew Lynch.

According to sources close to the investigation, Abballa made the statement to negotiations during a tense stand-off that lasted for several hours. The killer known for his radical Islamist views to the intelligence services had taken the trio-year-old son hostage and refused to surrender.The attack began around 8:30pm local time when Abballa stabbed to death 42-year-old officer Jean-Baptiste Salvaing and his 36-year-old wife Jessica Schneider who was also a police employee. The couple's young son was in the house at the time of the attack but miraculously escaped unharmed. Abballa, shot dead by the police on Tuesday morning, had a history of minor crimes and had been on the radar of French intelligence services since 2013. He was known to have been radicalized and had been in contact with Islamist extremists in Syria.

It is incomprehensible that the government makes it so difficult for citizens to access information on decision-making processes that affect their lives. \"The Cabinet Office has defended the policy, saying it is necessary to prevent email systems from becoming overwhelmed and to ensure that officials can concentrate on their work rather than handle large amounts of emails. Many are nevertheless skeptical of this explanation, pointing out that other government departments are able to maintain email records for longer periods without problem. The issue has raised concerns about the government's commitment to transparency and openness. This is not just about FOI requests, it's about the principle of accountability,\" said a leading transparency advocate. \"If the government is not willing to be transparent about its decision-making processes, how can we trust that they are acting in the public interest? \"The controversy has also raised questions about the role of technology in facilitating transparency. While digital tools have made it easier for governments to store and manage large volumes of data, they have also created new challenges for transparency and accountability. \"We need to rethink our approach to digital record keeping and ensure that it serves the public interest not only those in power. One thing is clear as the debate continues : the public has a right to know how their government is making decisions, and it is up to officials to ensure that they are transparent and accountable. The government must reconsider its email policy and work to create a more open and transparent system that serves the public interest. The controversy surrounding the Government's email - deletion policy has sparked a bigger discussion about the need for more transparency and accountability in government. Many are calling for a comprehensive overhaul of the way that government records are managed, with a focus on ensuring that digital tools are used to facilitate transparency rather than impede it. \"This is a wake-up call for governments around the world,\" said a leading expert in transparency and accountability. \"The use of digital tools has created new opportunities for transparency, but it also requires new approaches to record keeping and information management. Governments must recognize that transparency is not only a moral obligation, but also a fundamental right of citizens. The issue also raised concerns about the role of technology companies in facilitating government transparency. Many technology companies provide government email and data management services, and some have been accused of helping governments circumvent transparency laws. Technology companies have a responsibility to ensure that their products and services are designed with transparency and accountability in mind,\" said a digital rights advocate.",

In this case, it is unlikely that the parents intended to enter into a legally binding agreement when they accepted the party invitation. It is a bit of a stretch to say that the acceptance by a parent of a party invitation is a contract, said family law expert Sarah Johnson. \"While it's understandable that the host may be disappointed and out of pocket, it is not a legally binding agreement. \"Additionally, the fact that parents had a legitimate reason not to attend the party, that their son was double-booked, would likely be considered by a court. \"It is not as if the parents simply decided not to come from without a reason,\" said Johnson. They had a prior commitment that they had to honor, and it is not unreasonable to expect that they would prioritize the family obligations of their son over a party. In the end it is unlikely that Ms. Lawrence will be able to recover the \"No Show\" fee of £15,95 from Alex's parents. While it may be understandable that she is frustrated and out of pocket, the law is not on her side in this case.The incident serves as a reminder to parents to be mindful of their commitments and to communicate clearly with each other about their children's social obligations.

Should still have to be remunerated? Others have defended the practice of a fee for no-shows arguing that it helps to offset the costs of hosting a party and encourages parents to be more considerate of the time and resources of other people. \"As a host, you put in a lot of effort and expense to make sure everyone has a good time\", said another parent.",

The prime minister's comments have sparked controversy with animal welfare groups and opposition parties accusing her of being out of touch with the public opinion. A recent poll found that 84% of the British public oppose fox hunting, with many deeming it a cruel and inhumane practice. The shadow environment secretary of Labour, Sue Hayman, was quick to respond to Mrs. May's comments, saying: \"The Tories in the UK are out of touch with the British people on fox hunting. The majority of people want animal cruelty ended and not brought back. Labour will always fight for the animal welfare and protect the Hunting Act. Also last month the Tory MP Sir Roger Gale, who seeks re-election in North Thanet, expressed concerns that the party's position on fox hunting could alienate young voters. The issue of fox hunting has been a divisive one in British politics, with advocates arguing that it is a traditional and necessary part of rural life, while opponents argue that it is a cruel and unnecessary practice that causes suffering for animals.The Conservative Party's manifesto, expected to be published in the coming days, is likely to include a commitment to holding a free vote on the Hunting Act, allowing MPs to decide whether to repeal or amend the legislation. However, it As the debate surrounding the fox hunting continues to intensify, animal welfare groups are urging the public to make their voices heard in the upcoming election. The RSPCA, one of the leading animal welfare charities in the UK, launched a campaign to urge voters to \"stand up for animal welfare\" and reject any attempts to repeal the Hunting Act. \"Fox hunting is a cruel and outdated practice that has no place in modern Britain,\" said the RSPCA chief executive Chris Sherwood.",

The victory of the Conservative Party is also a testament to their ability to connect with voters on a local level. The UKIP victory also sparked concerns about the impact on the country's relations with the European Union. The anti-EU stance of UKIP has been a central part of their campaign and their success is likely to encourage eurosceptics across the country.

They have demanded that the government takes concrete steps to ensure that the responsible people are brought to justice and that measures are put in place to prevent such incidents from happening in the future. The incident has also raised questions about the role of the Pakistan Rangers, a paramilitary unit that is responsible for maintaining law and order in the country.

Some experience depressive symptoms only briefly, others have remitting and relapsing depression and some people are depressed all the time.Dr Simon Ridley, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said anyone concerned about either condition should seek help. \"The findings suggest that low levels of depression or fluctuating symptoms may not affect dementia risk but that a worsening of symptoms in the over-55s may be an early indicator of diseases like Alzheimer's,\" he said. \"It's important to remember that only a relatively small number of people experiencing symptoms of depression went on to develop dementia during this 11-year study, but anyone concerned about either condition should talk to their GP.\"",

The researchers focused on 3,107 participants diagnosed with depression at the start of the study but did not show any signs of dementia. Researchers monitored depressive symptoms and cognitive function of the participants over the course of six years. They found that those who had a gradual increase in depressive symptoms were more likely to develop dementia later in life. In contrast, participants who experienced chronic depression but with no worsening of symptoms over time did not appear to be at an increased risk of dementia. Similarly, those who experienced sudden onset of depression or whose symptoms fluctuated over the time, were not found to be at a higher risk for developing dementia. The findings of the study have important implications for the early detection and prevention of dementia. \"Our findings suggest that worsening depression in older adults may be a sign that dementia is developing,\" said Dr. Ikram. \"This could be a valuable tool for healthcare professionals to identify those at high risk of dementia and to take preventive measures. Researchers believe that the relationship between worsening depression and dementia may be due to shared underlying biological mechanisms. The study's results are consistent with previous research which suggested a link between depression and dementia. This is the first study to investigate the specific patterns of depressive symptoms that may be associated with an increased risk of dementia. The researchers hope that their findings will lead to the development of new strategies for preventing and treating dementia.

The victory is a crucial one for Gordon Strachan's side, who had been looking to rebound from their opening defeat to Germany last month in Group D. While the scoreline was not convincing, the Scottish performances marked a marked improvement from their lackluster show in Dortmund. The home side dominated possession and created a string of chances, but ultimately were forced to rely on an own goal from Akaki Khubutia to secure the three points.Shaun Maloney's powerful shot that was saved by Giorgi Loria but rebounds off Khubutia and into the net proved to be the decisive moment of the match. Scotland captain Scott Brown came close to double the lead with a deflected effort, but it was not to be. Scotland struggled to convert their chances into goals, with Steven Naismith and James Morrison both losing opportunities to extend the lead. Especially Naismith was guilty of wasting several chances, including a powerful shot that was saved by Loria and a marginally heavy touch that cost Scotland a very fine second goal.Georgia were already beaten by the Republic of Ireland at home, with Nikoloz Gelashvili's obtuse shot over the bar their only real chance of note. Scotland today tops Group D at third position, which is three points behind leaders Germany. The Scots will look to build on this momentum when they face Poland in their next qualifier in October.

Meanwhile, Murta's impressive form has propelled him into the spotlight and he will be looking to capitalize on this momentum in his upcoming matches. The tournament continues in Cyprus with several high-stakes matches scheduled for the coming days. Stay tuned for further updates and analysis from the world of tennis.",

        "text": "But reports of the Scot considering his future as a result of his unease with Mendes' sizeable involvement in Wolves' recruitment policy first surfaced earlier this month.Since the Premier League was launched in 1992, Wolves have spent just four of those 25 seasons in the top flight.They first won promotion under Dave Jones in 2003, only to come straight back down again.They then went back up again as champions under Mick McCarthy in 2009, spending three seasons there this time.Over the last 10 seasons, only one manager has taken over a Championship club in the summer, having finished the previous season at the same level, and then won automatic promotion in his first season.That was Steve Bruce, with Hull City in 2012-13 - and with a points haul (79) that would not have been good enough to make this season's play-offs.Having been appointed as Walter Zenga's successor on 5 November, Lambert was in charge for 33 matches in all competitions, of which Wolves won 14, lost 14 and drew five.A run of five successive league defeats in February dragged Wolves into a Championship relegation struggle, although they pulled well clear of the bottom three with five consecutive wins in March and April.They eventually finished 15th, seven points clear of the relegation zone.The highlights of Lambert's reign came in the FA Cup, in which Wolves won at Premier League opponents Stoke City and Liverpool before losing at home to double-chasing Chelsea in the fifth round.Media playback is not supported on this deviceBBC WM's Mike TaylorThe news of Lambert's departure is not surprising, since it is now three weeks since reports of the apparent rift between him and the club first appeared, although no public comment confirming it was ever made by either side.Neither will it be a surprise when, and we expect it will probably be Wednesday, Nuno Espirito Santo is announced as his replacement.This decision by Wolves can be viewed either as a bold step forward with a fresh approach, or another unnecessary risk on a coach with no experience of a particularly treacherous league.What it does appear to make abundantly clear, though, is that the owners Fosun are very much influenced by the agent Jorge Mendes, to a greater degree than they have previously been prepared to admit. Lambert was never going to stand for that.Fans will have their own views on whether that is the right course. The opinions of the club's director Jeff Shi may also turn out to be of interest, given the enthusiastic language he used to describe Lambert's vital importance to the club's management team only a few weeks ago.",

        "text": "Lambert's departure puts an end to a tumultuous six-month spell at Molineux during which Wolves won just 13 of their 33 championship matches under his control. The team was 15th in the table, a disappointing return considering the significant investment in the squad during the summer. The search for Lambert's replacement is already underway, with Nuno Espirito Santo emerging as the leading candidate. The 43-year-old Portuguese coach has an impressive pedigree after having coached Porto to the Champions League Quarter Finals last season before he would be promoted by mutual consent of the club.Santo's appointment would mark a significant shift in Wolves' recruitment strategy, with the club likely to focus on signing players from the Portuguese market. This could lead to a influx of new faces at Molineux, with several players from Porto and other Portuguese clubs already linked to moves to the Midlands.Several other members of the backroom staff leave the club, including coaches Stuart Taylor and Rob Edwards, fitness coach Tony Daley and head of sport science. The clear out is part of a wider restructure of the coaching staff, with Fosun looking to bring in fresh faces to help the club achieve its goal of promotion to the Premier League. Fans of Wolves will be hoping that the appointment of a new head coach and backroom team will bring back stability and direction to the club, which has been lacking in recent months. With the new season just around the corner, Fosun and the new coaching staff are in pressure to deliver a successful campaign and to bring top-flight football back to Molineux. The departure of Lambert and his backroom staff marks a significant turning point in Wolves' history as the club looks to put behind a disappointing season and concentrate on their ultimate goal of Premier League promotion. Fosun, the club's Chinese owners, have been vocal about their ambition to establish Wolves as a top club and the appointment of Nuno Espirito Santo would be a major step towards achieving this goal. Santo’s impressive track record in Porto, where he guided the team to the Champions League quarter-finals, has made him a highly sought-after coach, and his arrival in Molineux would be a major coup for the club. The Portuguese coach is known for his attacking style of football, which would be a welcome change for Wolves fans who had grown tired of the team’s defensive approach under Lambert. Santo's teams are also known for their high-intensity pressing and their ability to dominate possession, which is a significant departure from Lambert's more cautious approach. The potential influx of Portuguese players to Molineux is also an exciting prospect for Wolves fans who have grown accustomed to seeing their team struggle to compete with the top teams in the championships.",

They pointed to his speech at the Welsh Conservative Conference in April where he described the failings of the Welsh NHS as a 'national scandal' and claimed that Offa Dyke had become a \"line between life and death\".The exchange is the latest in a series of bitter disputes between Tory UK ministers and the Labour Welsh Government over the NHS in recent weeks. The Welsh Government has accused Cameron and his colleagues of trying to undermine their authority and create a false narrative about the state of the Welsh NHS. Despite the backlash, Cameron remains unapologetic and insists that he has a duty to speak out about issues that affect the whole of the UK, including those devolved to the Welsh government. The stance of the Prime Minister has sparked a heated debate about the role of the UK government in devolved matters and the limits of criticism when it comes to sensitive issues like healthcare.As the row continues to escalate, it remains to be seen how the Welsh government will respond to Cameron's latest comments and whether the dispute will have any lasting impact on the relationship between Westminster and Cardiff Bay.",

Rogic's late intervention nevertheless ensured that Celtic would lift the Scottish Cup for the 40th time in their history.The victory marks a remarkable achievement for Celtic who have won nine consecutive domestic titles under Lennon.

We need to take a tough stance on extremism, and that means being willing to take on the mosques and the imams who preach hate and intolerance. The comments of Nuttall have been met with outrage from many in the Muslim community who argue that UKIP policy is discriminatory and will only serve to further marginalize and stigmatize British Muslims. \"This is just more of the same old Islamophobic rhetoric from UKIP's,\" said Mohammed Shafiq, the chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation. They are trying to scapegoat an entire community for the actions of a tiny minority. It is shameful and it is dangerous. \"But Nuttall remains unapologetic, stating that his party is the only willing to face tough questions head-on. \"We're not going to be swayed by political correctness or fear of offending certain groups\", he said. \"We will always tell the truth, even when it's uncomfortable, because that's what the British people deserve.

The comments of the UKIP leader have generated a heated debate with many calling for greater scrutiny of extremist ideologies while others argue that his party's stance is divisive and will only serve to further marginalise British Muslims. The Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was quick to condemn Nuttall's comments, saying that they were \"dangerous and irresponsible\". \"We need to work together to tackle the root causes of Extremism, not demonize an entire community,\" Corbyn said. \"UKIP’s policies are a recipe for division and hatred and will only serve to make our country less safe. \"The Liberal Democrats also weighed in, with the leader Tim Farron saying that Nuttall's comments were \"toxic and harmful\".",

There, the Socialist candidate rejected his party's call to pull out.French regions have wide powers over local transport, education and economic development.The far right has been steadily gaining votes over the past few years from both left- and right-wing sympathisers through a mix of nationalist and pro-welfare policies, correspondents say.In the lead-up to the first round, opinion polls suggested that the popularity of the anti-immigration, anti-EU FN had increased since the deadly attacks in Paris on 13 November.Who were Paris attackers?How the Paris attacks unfoldedThe FN is hoping a strong performance will boost Marine Le Pen's chances in the 2017 presidential election.The government's response to the Paris attacks has boosted President Hollande's approval ratings - they have soared more than 30 percentage points to 50%.However, this surge in personal popularity has so far not translated into greater approval for Mr Hollande's Socialist Party.",

The results have sent shockwaves through the French political establishment, with many warning about the dangers of a FN victory. The second round of voting is set to take place on 13 December, with the top two candidates in each region competing for the top spot. The Socialists decision to withdraw their candidates from vulnerable seats is seen as a desperate attempt to prevent the FN from achieving control over multiple regions. \"This is a crucial moment for French democracy,\" a spokesperson for the Socialist Party said. \"We cannot allow the far right to gain a foothold in our regions. We call on all Democratic candidates to rally behind the Republican candidates to prevent a FN victory. Marine Le Pen has hailed the First Round results as a \"historic victory\" for her party and said that it marks a \"turning point\" in French politics. \"The French people have spoken and they have rejected the failed policies of the traditional parties,\" she said in a statement. The outcome of the second round is far from certain, with many voters still undecided and the campaign to be intense in the coming days. However, a thing is clear: the stakes are high and the future of French politics hangs in the balance. As the dust settles on the first round of voting, the French political landscape is bracing itself for a tumultuous two weeks of campaigning ahead of the second round. The decision of the Socialists to withdraw their candidates from vulnerable seats has sparked a heated debate about the nature of democracy and the role of traditional parties in French politics. Critics of the move argue that it is a cynical plot to support Republicans and prevent the FN from having a foothold in the regions.",

The decision, ratified by the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) with a 12-6 vote, has raised concerns among some MPA members that it may dissuade potential candidates from joining the force. However, Martin Tiplady, Met's Human Resources manager, defended the move and affirmed that it was \"the right way forward.\" According to Tiplady, the new policy will not only improve the quality of recruits but also result in significant cost savings. He estimated that the Met will save in salary costs between £12,000 and £20,000 per officer during their training period.The change is part of the Met's efforts to revamp its recruitment process and to ensure that new officers are better prepared to handle the demands of modern police. By requiring an unpaid internship, the Met aims to attract candidates who are truly committed to a career in law enforcement. While some have expressed concerns about the potential impact on diversity and inclusion, Tiplady argued that the new policy will actually help to attract a more diverse range of candidates. He said: \"We want to attract people who are passionate about policing and willing to put in the hard work to become a great officer,\" he said. The new recruitment policy for the Met is set to take effect later this year with the first cohort of interns expected to start their training in summer. As the force continues to evolve and adapt to the changing needs of the community, it remains to be seen how this new policy will affect the quality and diversity of its recruits. The decision of the Metropolitan Police Service to introduce unpaid internships for new officers sparked a heated debate among law enforcement experts, community leaders and potential recruits. While proponents of the policy argue that it will attract more dedicated and passionate candidates, critics warn that it may exacerbate existing issues of diversity and inclusion within the force. One of the primary concerns is that the unpaid internship requirement may deter candidates from lower-income backgrounds who may not have financial means to support themselves during the training period. \"This policy is a step backwards for diversity and inclusion\", said councillor Jasmine Ali, a member of MPA who voted against the proposal.",

It narrowly escaped bankruptcy back then by raising money from specialist investors which reduced the wider Cooperative Group share to just 20%.Co-op Bank has been limping along since then with less shock-absorbing capital than the regulator thinks is appropriate for a four million customer bank and the Bank of England stands ready if other options fail. Ultimately, that could mean the dismantling of a 160 year old financial institution and the biggest financial rescue since 2009.To be clear, we are not at that point yet.Potential buyers have until 4 April to submit their bids for the company and there are the options already discussed to raise money after that date. Financial markets are betting heavily against Co-op Bank's survival in its current form, BUT the fact that its bonds are worth anything at all means some investors still think Bank of England intervention is avoidable.Co-op customers have very little to fear as current accounts, personal loans and mortgages would be taken on by another bank if necessary and deposits up to £85,000 are guaranteed by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.Customers of the ethically focused Co-op bank have been very loyal during a period which has seen big losses, branch closures and a drug scandal involving its former non-executive chairman, Paul Flowers dent the financial and ethical integrity of Co-op bank.It may yet live to fight on, but the Bank of England is braced for its failure.",

However, it has struggled to compete with larger rivals in recent years and has been plagued by IT problems and poor management decisions. The current predicament of the bank has sparked concerns about the stability of the UK financial system. While the Bank of England has stated that the Co-op Bank's problems are not systemic, there are fears that a failure of the bank could have a ripple effect on the entire industry.

They are more interested in lining their own pockets than providing decent, safe and affordable housing for people who need it most. The council called on Malik to increase its efforts to crack down on the rogue landlords, including increasing the number of inspections and prosecutions for those who fail to meet basic standards. \"We need to send a clear message to these notorious landlords that we will not tolerate their exploitation of vulnerable people,\" he said. It is time for us to take a stand and ensure that everyone in this city has access to a safe and affordable place to call home. The council is set to discuss a range of measures aimed at improving the private rental sector, including increased licensing requirements for landlords and tougher penalties for those who fail to comply with the regulations. The move comes as the city faces a growing housing crisis, with thousands of people on the waiting list for social housing and many more struggling to afford the high rents charged by private landlords. Local housing campaigners have been calling for more action to be taken against rogue landlords. \"This is a major step forward in the fight against exploitation and neglect in the private rental sector,\" says Sarah Johnson, Chair of the local housing campaign group. \"We welcome the commitment of Councillor Malik to act and look forward to seeing real change on the ground\"",

Such twins usually die before birth.The abnormality is estimated to occur in 1 in 500,000 live births.Is it unusual to live so long with the twin?One widely reported case was of a 36-year-old man in India whose tumour had grown so big that he was having difficulty breathing.In villages or smaller towns where access to medical facilities are limited, it is possible for someone to not know they have a foetus and live with it their entire life, says Dr Raman.The abnormality is easily spotted if a baby undergoes an ultrasound or CT scan, and there have been cases of babies as young as three months old being operated on.",

The 10-year-old boy who has not been named was admitted to a hospital in Kuala Lumpur after complaining of severe abdominal pain. According to his mother, the fetus was fully formed with organs like those of a baby including legs, hands and genitals. The mother who wishes to remain anonymous told Bernama news agency that the family was shocked and devastated by the discovery. She said: \"We had no idea that our son was carrying a twin fetus inside him. We thought it was just normal stomachache, but when doctors told us what was really going on, we were stunned. The condition known as fetus in fetu is an extremely rare occurrence, where a fetus develops inside the body of its twin. It is estimated that only about 1 in every 500,000 births occurs. Doctors at the hospital where the boy was treated said that the fetus was likely formed during the early stages of pregnancy, when the twins were still in the womb. However, instead of developing normally, the second fetus became trapped inside the boy's body. The boy underwent surgery to remove the fetus and is currently recovering in hospital. His mother said that the family performed funeral rites for the fetus and buried it at a local cemetery. \"This has been a very difficult and emotional experience for our family,\" said the mother. \"We are just grateful that our son is safe and receiving the medical care that he needs. A widespread interest and concern among medical professionals in Malaysia has sparked, with many calling it a \"medical miracle\" and a \"one-in-a-lifetime\" event. Ahmad Faisal, a leading pediatrician in Kuala Lumpur, said that the case highlighted the importance of regular medical check-ups and screenings, especially for children. \"This case is a reminder that even the most unusual and rare medical conditions can occur, and it's crucial that we are vigilant and proactive in detecting and treating them,\" he said. The boy's family requested privacy during this difficult time, but their story has already sent shockwaves through the medical community and beyond.",

Non-Muslims were singled out to be killed.Mr Timamy belongs to a political affiliate of Mr Kenyatta's governing Jubilee coalition.He will remain in police custody until 30 June, while investigations continue.The attacks earlier in June killed at least 60 people, as gunmen descended on hotels and a police station.It was the most deadly attack in Kenya since last September, when at least 67 people were killed by al-Shabab fighters at Nairobi's Westgate shopping centre.Analysis: Emmanuel Igunza, BBC News, MombasaGovernor Timamy is a high-profile politician, so the case has attracted much interest.Senior politicians from the coastal region accompanied him to court while supporters thronged the court precincts in a show of solidarity.The charges levelled against Mr Timamy are perhaps an indication of how serious the government wants to stick to its line - that local politics were behind the killings.But it is not clear why a politician affiliated to the ruling coalition would be the first target of arrests.Most of the people killed in the attacks were ethnic Kikuyus. Mr Timamy is an ethnic Bajuni, an indigenous group from Lamu County. Many of the native communities have had long-standing differences with members of the Kikuyu community, who they say came to the area and \"took over their land\".But whether this is a simmering dispute over land, or a terror attack by al-Shabab, this case will be a defining moment in the fight against terrorism in Kenya - and the fragile relationship of the communities in the area.Five people were killed in another attack on Tuesday by an armed gang on the village of Witu, about 15km (9 miles) from Mpeketoni.The following day the authorities said they had arrested 13 alleged separatists accused of planning more attacks on the coast.Lamu island is a well-known tourist resort. However, the attacks happened on the mainland, in Lamu County.Correspondents say there are long-standing political and ethnic divisions in the area around Mpeketoni, as well as disagreements over land ownership.Land disputes were behind much of the ethnic violence which broke out across Kenya after the disputed 2007 elections.",

The violence was characterized by widespread destruction of property, including homes, businesses and infrastructure. Defendants allege that Timamy, who has been accused of having ties to the Somali militant group Al-Shabaab, played a key role in planning and financing the attacks. They claim that he provided logistical support and funding to the perpetrators, who were largely a part of the Al-Shabaab terrorist organization. However, Timamy's attorney has denied the charges and called them 'baseless and politically motivated'. The lawyer claimed that his client was a respected member of the community and had no involvement in the attacks.The charge of Timamy is seen as a significant development in the case, which has been marked by delays and controversy. The case against Timamy is expected to be closely watched, with many hoping it will shed light on the circumstances surrounding the attacks and bring closure to the victims and their families. In a statement, the Kenyan government welcomed the arrest of Timamy, saying it showed the country's commitment to fighting terrorism and bringing perpetrators to justice. The trial is expected to begin in the coming weeks, with prosecutors vowing to present a strong case against Timamy.

Southern Africa is experiencing prolonged dry weather amid worries over the survival of crops and cattle. \"Severe droughts and devastating flooding being experienced throughout the tropics and sub-tropical zones bear the hallmarks of this El Niño, which is the strongest in more than 15 years,\" said WMO secretary-general Michel Jarraud.The authorities in California are expecting that El Niño will bring extremely wet conditions to the state in the early part of 2016.

The club’s new manager Pedro Caixinha has spoken highly about the player and is believed to be keen to integrate him into his plans for the upcoming season. Despite this, the winger’s lack of playing time towards the end of the last season has led to concerns about his future at the club. With Forest and other clubs circling, it remains to be seen whether Rangers will be able to hold on to one of their most talented players.The situation is likely to come to a head in the coming weeks with the transfer window soon open. Rangers fans will be keeping close watch on developments hoping that their club can retain the services of a player who has been a key part of their team in recent years. As the transfer window approaches, Rangers fans are eagerly anticipating a potentially tumultuous summer. The situation of the winger is only one of several storylines set to dominate the headlines in the coming weeks.Another player whose future is uncertain is the club's star striker, who has been linked with a move to the English Premier League. The striker, who has been a prolific goaltender for Rangers, has reportedly attracted the attention of several top-flight clubs, including West Ham United and Crystal Palace. The Rangers are said to be determined to hold onto their prized asset, but the lure of a big-money move to the Premier League may prove too great for the player to resist. The fans of the club are desperate to see their star man stay, but they are also realistic in the financial realities of the situation.

According to a statement by the Afghan Ministry of Defence, the joint operation of Afghan and coalition forces was aimed at taking Taliban militants from a key district in Zabul province The operation was deemed a success, with several Taliban fighters killed and wounded and a significant amount of weapons and ammunition confiscated. However, as the Afghan and coalition forces were withdrawing from the area, they were under heavy fire from Taliban insurgents. In response, coalition forces called in air support to provide cover for their retreat. The airstrike that followed subsequently mistakenly targeted the ANA and the translator, who were reportedly located in the same vicinity as the Taliban fighters. The incident has sparked outrage among Afghan officials who have long expressed concerns about the risks of civilian casualties and friendly fire in coalition air strikes. The Afghan government has launched an investigation into the incident and NATO officials have promised to cooperate fully. The deaths of the Afghan soldier and the translator bring the total number of Afghan security forces killed in the last week to at least 15, highlighting the ongoing risks and challenges faced by Afghan forces as they take on a greater role in the fight against the Taliban. In a statement, NATO officials expressed their condolences to the families of victims and reiterated their commitment to minimizing civilian deaths and preventing friendly fire incidents. However, the incident is likely to fuel ongoing debates about the effectiveness and risks of coalition airstrikes in Afghanistan and the need for greater caution and precision in military operations. The incident has also raised concerns about the reliance on air strikes in the fight against the Taliban, with many arguing that the tactic can be indiscriminate and lead to unintended consequences.

It will be a tough few weeks but we are confident in our ability to get the results we need, he said. \"If fans can keep creating that atmosphere, I'm sure we can make it a very interesting end to the season\" The former Scotland international’s comments come as Rangers prepare to face Aberdeen in Pittodrie on Saturday, a fixture that has historically been a difficult one for the Light Blues. However, with the team's recent form and fans' back, the striker believes they can rise on top. \"Aberdeen is always a tough game, but we are confident in our ability to get the result we need,\" he said. The team has been hard on the training pitch and we're satisfied about our chances. If the fans can bring that energy and passion to Pittodrie, I'm sure we can make it a very tough day for Aberdeen. The recent win by the Rangers over Hamilton was a testament to the power of the fans, with the stadium bursting in a frenzy of noise and color as the team scored the winning goal.",

Taxis, delivery vehicles, buses and emergency vehicles are still allowed.Initially some drivers complained that the move was not well publicised and claimed the signs warning of the bus gate were inadequate.Some also wrongly assumed that the gate was a temporary measure during the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games.If a motorist issued with a notice pays up within 14 days, they are charged £30 - and most do pay up within a fortnight. If they pay up later, they are charged £60.Councils across Scotland are adamant bus gates are only put in place to help the environment and public transport, and strongly deny claims from opponents that they are a source of revenue.Even the £1.3m from Nelson Mandela Place is still a drop in the ocean compared to Glasgow City Council's annual budget of more than £2bn.In July and August last year, 30,000 notices were issued to motorists.The number then fell substantially in September to 5,000 and has gradually declined since.Approximately 10,000 notices were served between April and July this year - 2,334 of them last month. If all the motorists who received a notice last month pay up within 30 days, the fines will total £70,000.Councillor Alistair Watson, Glasgow City Council's executive member for Sustainability and Transport, said: \"One of the aims of the bus gate is to reduce the number of vehicles travelling through the city centre, while improving provision for public transport. \"There is always a period of adjustment when new restrictions are introduced. It's clear from the reduction in offences that drivers are aware of the bus lanes and have modified the route they take. \"The majority of the city's drivers won't receive bus lane charges since they don't drive through what is now a well-known and very visible bus gate. \"The number of offences has dropped significantly and hopefully we will see even further reductions. Most drivers contravening the bus gate pay the penalty within 14 days which reduces their fine to £30. \"In 2013, Edinburgh City Council received £718,000 from bus lane fines while Aberdeen City Council received £896,000.That year Glasgow received a total of £3,283,776.",

Motorists that fail to pay the £60 charge within a specified timeframe are issued a penalty notice, which increases to £120 if not paid within 28 days. However, it seems that many drivers are choosing to ignore the fines, leaving the council to pursue them through the courts. A spokesperson for Glasgow City Council has confirmed that the authority is taking steps to recover outstanding debts, but warned that it could take months to resolve the issue. \"We understand that some motorists may be experiencing financial difficulties but it is important that we take action to recover the revenue owed by the council,\" said the spokesperson. \"We will continue to work with our enforcement partners to pursue those who have failed to pay their fines and we will not hesitate to take further action if necessary. The news has sparked concern among local business owners who fear that the lack of payment could affect the city's ability to invest in vital infrastructure projects. \"It's unacceptable that so many motorists are flouting the law and refusing to pay their fines,\" said James McTavish, the owner of a local shop. The council should take a tougher stance on this issue and ensure that those who break the rules are redressed. The council has promised to review its enforcement strategy in light of the figures and is considering introducing new measures to improve compliance rates. In the meantime, drivers are warned to pay their fines promptly to avoid further action. **Glasgow City Council Faces £2 Million Shortfall in Congestion Fee Fines** The news has sent shockwaves through the city's business community with many calling for the council to take immediate action to address the issue. \"This is a staggering amount of money that could be used to improve our city’s infrastructure and services,\" said Councillor Susan Aitken, the leader of the opposition. The council must tackle this situation and ensure that those who are breaking the rules are held responsible. The congestion charge introduced in 2018 was designed to reduce traffic congestion in the city center and encourage the use of public transport, cycling and walking. However, it appears that many motorists are finding ways to avoid paying the fines, leaving the council to pay the bill. According to the Council's figures, the majority of non-regular fines are from drivers who are not registered in Glasgow, with many from outside the UK.",

As the deadline approaches, the fate of the former prison remains uncertain. One thing is clear: the rich history and cultural significance of the site will play a crucial role in its future. The debate surrounding the former prison site is continuing and experts weigh in on the possible archaeological discoveries that could be made. Dr. Emma Taylor, a leading archaeologist, believes that the site is holding secrets that could redefine the history of the region. \"The history of the prison dates back to the 18th century, and it is likely that there are hidden artifacts and structures beneath the surface of the prison\", Dr. Taylor said. The result could be a thorough excavation of the original design of the prison as well as the lives of the prisoners who were held here. Taylor's team has conducted preliminary surveys of the site which revealed promising signs of hidden features. \"We've detected anomalies in the ground that indicate that there may be hidden tunnels or cellblocks\", she said.",

One is so affronted he stands up in the House of Commons and accuses his government of \"polishing a poo\". Such is the elevation of political discourse that the European Union engenders.And yet David Cameron is on his feet at a factory in Wiltshire claiming the draft reform deal published by Donald Tusk would leave Britain \"better off, more secure, more prosperous\". The settlement, the prime minister said, gave Britain the \"best of worlds\" and that was \"something worth fighting for\".So yes, Mr Cameron may have to spend the next two weeks twisting arms in Europe, there may be no guarantee of a deal and everyone is agreed that nothing is agreed until everything agreed.But the prime minister is already in campaign mode, bouncing around tiggerishly in his shirtsleeves, selling his deal almost as if it had been agreed.There will be an emergency brake on in-work benefits imposed on EU migrants, they will be able to send less child benefit home, there will be greater protection for businesses from the Eurozone, parliaments will get more powers to block EU laws, the UK will escape further political integration within the EU, there are legally binding promises to make the EU more competitive.And there will be changes to make it easier for the UK to exclude terror suspects even if there is no imminent threat.So here's the point. However much this package is diluted or changed in coming weeks, Mr Cameron now believes he will have enough of a deal to sell to the British people. And that means that he can begin to make his case for Britain to remain within the EU from today.And that will have consequences. Tory ministers who want to support the campaign to leave the EU are champing at the bit, silenced by collective responsibility while the prime minister gets his campaign rolling.They will be released from their omerta once the cabinet has agreed the government's official position after the summit later this month.But that means the PM has a clear couple of weeks where he can own the political space - as long as his ministers behave.It also illustrates Mr Cameron's impatience for a quick referendum in June while his opponents are divided and before refugee numbers have reached their summer peak.So Mr Cameron insists that what he wants is the right deal not a quick deal.But today he gave every impression of being a man in a hurry, keen to start campaigning even while he's still negotiating.In other words, the referendum campaign has begun.",

One senior EU diplomat was quoted saying that \"We saw more decisive language on a packet of cereal. The Prime Minister's team has been quick to defend the proposals, insisting that they represent a \"significant step forward\" in the Brexit negotiations and that the criticism is unfair. However, with many of the key details still shrouded in uncertainty, it is hard to see how the government can expect to win over skeptics on either side of the debate. As the news breaks, the pound takes a hit on the currency markets, with investors clearly unimpressed by the lack of clarity and direction. Meanwhile, backbencher MPs are already beginning to mobilize against the proposals, with some threatening to rebel against the government if the final agreement doesn't meet their expectations.It's clear that the road ahead will be a rocky one, with the government facing a tough battle to win hearts and minds. One commentator wryly observed: \"It's not just the EU that has a problem with the UK's Brexit plans - it's the UK itself.\" As the day goes on, the criticism only intensifies, with business leaders and trade unions joining in the chorus of disapproval. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) releases a statement expressing \"deep disappointment\" over the lack of clarity on key issues such as trade and migration, while the Trades Union Congress (TUC) warns that the proposals will lead to a \"boss of workers rights\". Senior officials are attempting to respond to the backlash with emergency meetings with MPs and industry leaders in an attempt to shore up support. But it's clear that the government is on the back foot, with even some of its own MPs expressing doubts about the proposals. One conservative backbencher, who wished to remain anonymous, told our reporter: \"I'm not sure what the Prime Minister was thinking.\" This is a deal by a dog. We're going to have to go back and start again. As the debate rages on, attention is turning to the upcoming parliamentary vote on the proposals. The government's majority is also uncertain, with the Labor and Liberal Democrats already swearing to oppose the deal. The DUP (Democratic Unionist Party) which has backed up the government since the last election, warns its leader Arlene Foster that she will not support a deal that \"undermines the integrity of the UK.\"",

President Trump, however, is not thought to be among them.Yet that didn't spare him a ribbing from Kimmel, or from being taken to task both obliquely and directly.Asghar Farhadi, the Iranian director of best foreign film The Salesman, stayed away in protest at the Trump administration's travel ban on immigrants.In his absence, a speech was read out that castigated the \"inhumane\" legislation for disrespecting his homeland and the six other countries it targeted.There were many moments to cherish at this year's Oscars - some humorous, some moving and some downright calamitous.Yet perhaps the most telling came when the stars of Hidden Figures arrived to announce the winner for best documentary feature.With them came Katherine Johnson, the 98-year-old African-American woman who was one of the real-life inspirations behind the space race drama.Could a woman born in 1918, who has lived through Jim Crow, segregation and the fight for civil rights, have ever dreamed of a day when her presence at the Oscars would generate a spontaneous standing ovation?La La Land may have won the most awards at this year's ceremony, but diversity was surely the biggest winner of all on Hollywood's glitziest night.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

He claimed that he had been told to look for other jobs since December, when the £26m settlement was ordered. \"We have also been told repeatedly that announcements regarding our jobs were coming,\" he said. \"But I'm still angry with Npower because they've been so secretive. They keep saying that we're a family and that they will be open with us. Meanwhile they're saying something else behind our backs. \"Last month, the company announced a 5.2% cut in its gas price, taking effect on 28 March - a £32 average annual reduction to customers on a standard domestic tariff.Like other energy suppliers, it is under pressure from ministers and consumer groups to lower energy bills for customers amid the rapid decline in oil and gas prices.The news on job losses also comes days before UK competition regulators unveil plans to make the energy market more transparent for consumers.Labour's energy secretary Lisa Nandy said: \"This is terrible news for Npower workers and another blow for the energy industry after so many North Sea and solar job losses.\"",

The company has struggled to compete with smaller, more agile energy suppliers and faced criticism for its customer service and billing practices. The £26 million settlement with UK regulators in December was a major embarrassment to the company and highlighted the need for significant changes to its operations. The regulator Ofgem has determined that Npower had failed to provide accurate bills to customers, and had not dealt with complaints in a timely or effective manner. Job losses are expected in Npower's sales and marketing teams, which have been seen as bloated and inefficient. The company has been accused of using high-pressure sales tactics to win new customers and has faced criticism for its door-to-door sales practices. The cuts are also likely to have a significant impact on the UK economy, especially in areas where Npower has a large presence. The company has operations in several parts of the country, including in the North East, the Midlands and the South West. RWE is the latest in a series of cost-cutting measures taken by the German energy giant in recent years. The company has been struggling to adapt to a rapidly changing energy market and has faced significant challenges in its core European markets. The news is likely to be closely watched by investors and industry analysts who will look for signs of a turnaround in the fortunes of Npower. The company's full-year results, which are due to be announced on Tuesday, are expected to provide further insight into the scale of the challenges facing the business.",

This was up from 31 the previous year.Mr Clarkson, a delegate from Leicestershire. suggested that some executive head teachers and heads were now able to look at their budgets and decide how much to pay themselves.The conference voted in favour of the motion that every school should publish its staffing structure and pay ranges of all teaching staff, including senior leadership salaries and those of executive head teachers. \"Let me remind you whose money is being used to do this - ours,\" said Mr Clarkson. \"Let me remind you who this money should be spent on - the children and young people in our care. \"So I call for senior leadership salaries, including the salaries of executive head teachers to be published by schools. \"\"Once, the accountability was provided for by local authorities,\" said Mr Clarkson. \"County council offices up and down the country, elected members and council officers made sure that schools both kept to the rules and served the needs of their local communities. \"Schools and colleges are facing cuts, despite government assurances it has protected budgets, the conference in Liverpool has heard.Schools may be getting the same budgets as last year but costs are rising, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers annual conference was told. \"How many times have you heard that education funding is protected?\" asked delegate Robin Bevan. \"It is not true, but it is the current educational mantra\".Schools and colleges are having to pay increased pensions and national insurance contributions for staff out of their budgets, while other costs, such as utility bills are also rising, said Mr Bevan.",

Clarkson's speech was met by the conference delegates with applause, many of whom expressed frustration and anger at the lack of transparency in education sector. \"It is time for schools to be honest about how they spend their money,\" said one delegate. \"If they are paying such high salaries to their senior staff, they should be prepared to explain them to the public. The ATL's call for greater transparency comes as the education sector faces increasing scrutiny over its spending habits. A report by the National Audit Office last year found that some academy trusts were paying their senior staff \"unjustifiably high\" salaries, while others failed to provide adequate financial information to the public. The Department of Education said it was committed to improving transparency in the education sector but has stopped short of requiring schools to publish their senior staff salaries. A spokesperson said that schools were already required to publish their financial information online and that this provided sufficient transparency.

This unique mix that was designed to combat the region's notorious smog is more expensive to produce, contributing to the price hike.

Rolling Stone is different because it's done so much over the decades to shape American popular and celebrity culture.To some, then, a bomb suspect is being depicted as a cultural icon. The sepia-tinted photograph, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev appears rather dreamy and vacant, looks like a relic from the 70s. Again, it has fuelled criticisms that the magazine is softening, even glamorising, his alleged crimes.This controversy also says a lot about the state of the American magazine market, and the pressure on publications to produce eye-catching and newsy images. This week Newsweek spliced together the portraits of the Florida teenager Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman, the man acquitted last weekend of his murder. Bloomberg's Businessweek depicted a hedge-fund manager with a graph coming from his groin that intentionally looked phallic. \"The cover story we are publishing this week falls within the traditions of journalism and Rolling Stone's long-standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day,\" it said.It added that many of its readers are in the same age group as the bombing suspect, and it was important for the publication to explore the issue.But two Massachusetts-based convenience store chains, Rockland and Tedeschi Food Shops, as well as Cumberland Farms, said on Wednesday they would not stock the edition.Two national pharmacy chains, CVS and Walgreens, quickly followed suit.Boston Mayor Thomas Menino said on Wednesday the Rolling Stone was \"ill-conceived, at best, and reaffirms a terrible message that destruction gains fame for killers and their 'causes'\".Boston City Council President Stephen Murphy said the cover was \"disgusting\". \"Rolling Stone has marketed Tsarnaev as a hero, a misunderstood teen, a product of two incompatible cultures,\" he said in a statement. \"He is not. He is a coward and a murderer who is appropriately facing the death penalty for his crimes. \"Commentators on social media networks also said the magazine cover was tasteless.Some likened the picture of the suspect, which he posted online himself, to an old Rolling Stone cover featuring Jim Morrison, lead singer of The Doors.More than 15,000 mainly outraged comments were posted on Rolling Stone's Facebook page.Boston punk band Dropkick Murphys, who recently donated $300,000 (Â£197,000) to victims of the bombings, also expressed their anger. \"Rolling Stone you should be ashamed,\" the band tweeted. \"How about one of the courageous victims on your cover instead of this loser scum bag!\"",

Other people have defended the magazine's decision, arguing that it is a legitimate news story and that the cover image is a reflection of the complexity of Tsarnaev's character. The fact that he looks like a normal kid is what makes this story so fascinating, wrote one commentator. It's not about glorifying him, it is about trying to understand what drove him to commit such a vile act. The controversy has also sparked a wider debate about the role of the media in covering sensitive and controversial topics. Should news outlets be more careful with the images they use and how they present their stories, or is it their job to simply report facts and allow the public to decide? Rolling Stone has stood by its decision, saying that the article is a \"deeply reported\" and \"thoughtful\" exploration of Tsarnaev's life and motivations. Editors of the magazine have also pointed out that they have a long history of covering controversial subjects and figures ranging from Charles Manson to O.J. Simpson.As the debate continues to rage, one thing is clear: the decision to feature Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on the cover of Rolling Stone has sparked a national debate about the media role in shaping our perceptions of the world around us. The controversy surrounding Rolling Stone's cover also raised questions about the impact of media representation on public opinion. Some argue that the magazine is humanizing Tsarnaev by featuring him on the cover and potentially creating a sense of empathy or even sympathy among readers. Others counter that the article is a necessary exploration of the complexities of terrorism and the factors that drive individuals to commit such acts. \"This is not about glorifying Tsarnaev, but about understanding the roots of terrorism,\" said Dr. Sarah Jones, a media studies expert at Harvard University. By investigating the life and motivations of someone like Tsarnaev, we can gain a deeper understanding of social and psychological factors that contribute to radicalization. \"However, others disagree, arguing that the cover image is insensitive and disrespectful to victims of the Boston Marathon bombing and their families.",

They warned that the number of casualties could rise. \"They have managed to control the fire in most parts of the factory, but  the warehouse is still burning,\" he said. \"The bodies are charred beyond recognition. \"Police officer Ameer Hossain told the Daily Star that nine bodies had been recovered. Other accounts put the toll at 10.Clothing makes up around three-quarters of Bangladesh's total exports, and the factory collapse prompted protests and calls for improved safety measures.Dozens of international retailers agreed a plan last July to conduct inspections at factories from which their goods were sourced.",

I ran as fast as I could, but many of my colleagues didn't make it out of. Rescue teams worked through the night to find survivors and recover bodies from the charred remains of the factory.

In 2012, a fire at Tazreen Fashion factory in Dhaka killed 112 workers, underscoring the poor safety record of the country. Many factories in Bangladesh continue to operate with inadequate safety measures, putting thousands of workers at risk. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) has promised to investigate the latest incident and take action against any factory found negligent. However, labor rights groups say more needs to be done to protect workers. \"This tragedy is a stark reminder of the dangers faced daily by garment workers in Bangladesh,\" said Amirul Haque Amin, president of the National Garment Workers Federation. The government and the factory owners must take immediate action to improve safety standards and prevent such disasters from occurring again. The incident has also sparked international outrage with many calling for greater accountability from global fashion brands who source clothing from Bangladesh.As the investigation into the fire continues the people of Bangladesh are left to mourn the loss of life and demand change to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again. The Government of Bangladesh has announced that it will provide financial assistance to the families of the victims and has promised to take stern action against those responsible for the tragedy.

Because when Network Rail first did their sums, it was based on guesswork. They hadn't looked in detail at what needed doing and it was just much harder than they thought to upgrade Victorian bridges and tunnels on a line that was being kept open at the same time.So having kicked some of the promised electrification schemes into the long grass a while ago, the government's finally chopped them.New trains which are part diesel, part electric, will be used instead.Liberal Democrat Shadow Transport Secretary, Jenny Randerson, said: \"The Liberal Democrats secured vital investment for rail electrification when in government. \"That was then delayed by the Tories and now has been scrapped altogether. \"The government said it would introduce new Intercity Express trains in Wales with around 130 more seats and faster services.Wales' Economy Secretary, Ken Skates, told Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme: \"I don't buy it. \"He accused the UK government of \"years of broken promises\" and said Mr Grayling had not responded to his requests for a meeting on the issue. \"I'm urging the UK government to clarify the situation immediately,\" he added.The Department for Transport said the new services meant long distance journey times from Nottingham and Sheffield would be reduced by up to 20 minutes in peak periods.It said four direct services a day in each direction between Windermere and Manchester Airport will be introduced from May 2018.",

The government had planned to electrify the lines between Cardiff and Swansea, as well as the Midland main line between London and Sheffield. However, Mr. Grayling said that the new bi-mode trains could run on both electric and diesel power, providing a better solution for passengers. The Transport Secretary also announced that the government would invest in digital signalling technology, which would enable trains to run more frequently and reliably. The news has been met with mixed reaction from the passenger groups and rail industry experts. While some welcomed the investment in new trains and technology, others expressed disappointment over the decision to scrap the electrification plans. \"This is a short-sighted decision that will ultimately cost more in the long run,\" said Anthony Smith, CEO of passenger watchdog Transport Focus. \"Electrification is a more efficient and more environmentally friendly way to power our railways, and it is a shame that the government has chosen not to pursue it. However, the Rail Industry Association has welcomed the decision of the Government, saying that it would allow for a more flexible and efficient use of resources. The announcement by the Government is part of a wider package of measures aimed at improving the UK transport infrastructure. The Chancellor Philip Hammond is expected to give further details on the government's transport investment plans in the Autumn Budget later this year. The decision to scrap the electrification plans has sparked a heated debate among politicians with opposition parties accusing the government of breaking promises and neglecting the environment. \"This is a betrayal of the people of Wales and the Midlands that were promised a modern, electrified railway network,\" said Andy McDonald, Labour's Shadow Transport Secretary. The government's decision to abandon electrification is a short-sighted and environmentally damaging move that will leave passengers with old, polluting trains. The Liberal Democrats also weighed in, with their spokesperson for transport, Jenny Randerson, calling the decision \"a massive blow to the environment and passengers who were promised a better service. The government has defended his decision however, and said that the new bi-mode trains will still provide an important improvement in services for passengers. The government is committed to delivering a better rail network for passengers, and these new trains will provide a more reliable and comfortable service, said a spokesperson for the Department of Transport.",

Such an injury was called a 'Blighty', because it got the recipient sent back to Britain. \"Mr Hume, who spoke at Thursday night's event, said it had been an \"honour\" to interview Mr McConnell. \"I was very aware at the time that there weren't many Somme veterans left, and I have always seen it as an immense privilege to have met William McConnell and heard his stories. \"Mark McKinty is a UUP councillor and assistant conductor of the Magheramorne silver band - William McConnell was honorary president at the time of his death.He said: \"William McConnell's family attended the service and we played Abide With Me at his graveside because that was his favourite hymn. \"When the UK is remembering men like William McConnell and his comrades, it's important for us to do something because the local community is very proud of him. \"When I am taking part in remembrance events and I think of William and all that he did, I walk two inches taller.\"",

The sounds of gunfire and screaming, the smell of mud and blood, and the sight of companions falling all around him spoke to him. It was as if he was reliving the horror of that day all over again.\" McConnell's experiences during the Battle of the Somme were forever etched in his memory. He was just 19 years old when he enlisted with the Royal Irish Rifles and was sent to the front lines in France. On July 1st, 1916, he was part of the awful British offensive that resulted in over 60,000 losses on the first day alone. Despite the trauma he endured, Mr. McConnell spoke rarely of his wartime experiences until later in life. “He was a humble man who didn't seek attention to himself,” said Hume. But when he shared his stories it opened like a window into the past. You could never help but be moved by his words. The commemoration at the Larne Cemetery was a touching tribute to Mr. McConnell's courage and sacrifice. Members of Magheramorne Orange Lodge and Silver Band gathered at his grave where they laid wreaths and observed a minute's silence. The event was part of a national effort to mark the centenary of the Battle of Somme with similar vigils throughout the UK. As the clock struck 7:30 pm, the exact time the battle started 100 years ago, the crowd fell silent. The only sound was the distant hum of a lone piper playing a mournful lament. It was a haunting reminder of the a century ago devastating loss of life on the battlefields of France. The legacy of McConnell lives on through his stories that have been preserved for future generations. His bravery and sacrifice will never be forgotten, and the remembrance at his grave was a fitting tribute to a true hero of the Great War.",

He formed Motörhead in 1975 and continued to release 22 studio albums with the band, including the classic \"Ace of Spades\" and \"Overkill\". Throughout his career, Lemmy was known for his unapologetic attitude, his love of whiskey and cigarettes and his unwavering dedication to rock n' roll. He was also a prolific songwriter who created hits such as \"Born to Be Wild\" and \"We Are the Road Crew\". Tributes from across the music world have flown in, with Ozzy Osbourne, Slash and Dave Grohl being among the tributes paid to the metal legend.

The UK would be responsible for around 12% of that, producing a rough figure of €60bn (£52bn).Former Finnish prime minister, Alex Stubb, who recently met Barnier, explained the thinking in Brussels to BBC Newsnight.Mr Stubb said: \"Basically what's going to happen is that Article 50 is triggered and a few key principles will be agreed - say the principles of finance or the principles for EU citizens and British citizens in Europe - the big things. And then at the same time in parallel you can start negotiations on a  future relationship. \"Mr Barnier is telling the UK that the main principle of the financial settlement is that the UK will have to honour the legal commitments it made as a full member of the EU.The key element will be the cohesion fund which is used to pay for infrastructure projects in deprived parts of the EU.This accounts for around a third of the EU budget which lasts until 31 December 2020. All cohesion funding has been agreed for the current seven year budget and the UK would be expected to honour the commitments it gave when the current seven year EU budget was agreed by David Cameron in 2013.The UK will not be responsible for its full share of the budget up until 2020 because the EU agrees on large parts of the seven year budget on an annual basis.Any commitments agreed once the UK has triggered Article 50 will not have to be funded by the UK.Mr Barnier will also table what are described as \"standing commitments\" in Brussels made by all member states.These cover two key areas:Nicholas Watt is political editor for BBC Newsnight",

        "text": "By agreeing to discuss the future relationship with the EU in parallel with the Article 50 negotiations, Barnier is effectively acknowledging that the UK's exit from the EU cannot be separated from the terms of its future partnership. The EU's chief negotiator is said to be willing to engage in a more flexible and dynamic negotiation process which could potentially lead to a more rapid progress in the talks. This approach is likely to be welcomed by the UK government who has been keen to proceed beyond the initial phase of negotiations and to start discussing the details of the future trade relationship with the EU. However, it is understood that Barnier's concession comes with certain conditions. The UK first need to agree to the broad principles of the financial settlement, which is expected to be a contentious issue. The EU has estimated that the UK's divorce bill could be as high as €60 billion – a figure which has been disputed by the UK government. The EU is also seeking assurances on the rights of EU citizens living in the UK – a matter that has been a major sticking point in the negotiations so far. The EU wants to ensure that the rights of its citizens are protected and that they are not subject to discrimination or uncertainty as a result of the UK leaving the EU. If the UK agrees to these principles, Barnier is willing to open up the negotiations to cover all areas, including trade, security, and migration. This would allow the UK and EU to start discussing the details of their future relationship including the terms of a potential trade deal. The development comes as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to trigger Article 50, which will officially start the Brexit process. The UK government has indicated that it will trigger Article 50 in the final week of March, which starts a two-year countdown to the UK leaving the EU. Although the exact amount of the divorce settlement will be agreed later in the negotiations, the UK government is likely relieved that the EU is willing to engage in a more comprehensive and flexible negotiation process.",

Here's a man who sacrificed his life to save others. \"The auction in Devizes was one of the biggest involving Titanic memorabilia for many years.RMS Titanic had been four days into a week-long transatlantic crossing from Southampton to New York when the supposedly \"unsinkable\" ship struck an iceberg on 14 April 1912.The ship sank less than three hours later at about 02:20 on 15 April; 1,500 passengers and crew died and 710 survived.A collection of letters written by Chief Officer Henry Wilde, who was second in command on the vessel, fetched £5,000 at the auction.In one of the letters, written onboard Titanic and posted at Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland, Wilde indicated he had misgivings about the new ship. \"I still don't like this ship... I have a queer feeling about it,\" he wrote.He had been expecting to take command of another ship, the Cymric, and only signed on to the Titanic on 9 April 1912, the day before it sailed.On 31 March 1912, he said he was \"awfully disappointed to find the arrangements for my taking command of the Cymric have altered. I am now going to join the Titanic until some other ship turns up for me\".After the collision, Wilde took charge of the even-numbered lifeboats, and oversaw their loading and lowering into the water. He was among those who died in the tragedy.Mr Aldridge said: \"It is without doubt one of the finest Titanic-related letters, written by one of the liner's most senior officers on Olympic stationery. \"This lot reveals previously unknown details and shows Wilde's obvious disappointment in being transferred to Titanic. \"What is certain is that he worked diligently to load the boats once the seriousness of the situation was clear to him. \"Also included in the sale was a postcard from the ship's senior wireless operator, 25-year-old Jack Phillips, from Farncombe in Surrey, who carried on sending distress messages to other ships as the Titanic sank.Phillips, who drowned, was described as \"the man who saved us all\" by survivor and fellow wireless operator Harold Bridge.The card, signed \"Love all, Jack\", describes the weather as the ship left Cowes on the Isle of Wight.

The safe key, discovered in the possession of a former crew member, was one of the most anticipated loads of auction. It is believed to have been used to access the safe of the ship that contained valuables and important documents. Other notable items sold at the auction included a pocket watch belonging to a first-class passenger which fetched £40,000 and a section of the ship's anchor which sold for £30,000.The auction was held to mark the 110th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic, which happened on April 14 of 1912 after the ship collided with an iceberg in the North Atlantic Sea. The tragedy resulted in the loss of over 1,500 lives and has become one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. Proceeds from the auction will go to support maritime heritage charities and preserve the history of the Titanic for future generations. Among other notable items sold at the auction were a rare photograph of the Grand staircase of the Titanic that fetched £20,000, and a set of dinner plates used by the first class passengers of the ship which sold for £15,000. A personal letter written by a crew member, detailing his experiences on the ship, was also sold for £12,000. The auction was attended by collectors and historians from all over the world, many of whom were eager to get their hands on a piece of history. \"This auction was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own a piece of the Titanic,\" said the auctioneer James Parker. The items sold today are not only rare and historic, but they also provide a unique glimpse into the lives of the sailors aboard the ship. The sale of the safe key was especially significant, as it is one of the few remaining artifacts from the safe on board the ship. \"The Safe Key is an incredible piece of history,\" said Titanic historian Dr. Emma Taylor. \"It's a tangible link to the past of the ship and a reminder of the tragic events that occurred that fateful night. The auction was also attended by descendants of the Titanic passengers and crew who were emotional as they watched the items being sold.

We know that most parents only buy one pack at a time, so we hope that the impact of this limit on UK parents will be minimal,\" it added.Supermarkets Asda, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons said the purchase of certain brands would be limited to two units per customer per day.Foreign-made baby formula is popular in China, especially since a locally-manufactured formula laced with the industrial chemical melamine killed six infants in 2008 and caused another 300,000 to fall ill.Earlier this year, shops in Australia were forced to restrict sales of infant formula, as Chinese customers and tourists bought them in bulk to send them home or to sell them online.Authorities in Hong Kong also introduced restrictions in February to prevent shortages, banning travellers from leaving the territory with more than 1.8kg (4lb) of formula. Last month, 10 people were arrested there for trying to smuggle more than the allowed amount into mainland China.Danone said it was taking action to respond to the shortfall in the UK, including increasing production of milk, which means extra supplies of all its brands are arriving every week, according to BBC business correspondent Emma Simpson.Danone is also increasing production and supplies of its brands that are already available in China, in order to meet demand there.But it added: \"If parents are unable to find their baby's usual brand of milk, we recommend they try another local store or revisit the store on another occasion. \"Richard Dodd, head of media and campaigns at the British Retail Consortium, said: \"A number of retailers are limiting the amount of baby milk that can be bought by any one customer. \"Retailers are taking this precautionary step to ensure stocks continue to be available to everyone wanting baby milk,\" he added.However, Nestle insisted there were no shortages of its formula milk available to retailers.The company said: \"We do not have any evidence of bulk purchase of SMA for export, and we are in the process of contacting all our retail customers to confirm this, and to notify them that we do not have - and do not anticipate - any stock issues for powdered infant milks.We would like to reassure our consumers that we are not seeking to impose any limits on the sale of our formula, and any decision to do so is at the sole discretion of the retailer.

Many have reported seeing individuals buying large quantities of the products, which are then believed to be shipped to China where they can sell for a significant profit.A spokesperson for Tesco, one of the largest supermarkets in the UK, confirmed that the chain would introduce a two-can limit on Aptamil and Cow and Gate products. The issue is not limited to Danone products, with Nestle SMA milk also being affected. A spokesperson for Nestle said that while there were no stock shortages, the company was working with retail outlets to prevent bulk buying.The problem of baby milk being exported to China from the UK is not a new one. In 2013, a similar shortage of baby milk led to rationing in some supermarkets. The issue is thought to be driven by concerns over the safety of baby milk in China following a scandal in 2008 where melamine was found in baby milk formula that led to the deaths of six babies. In recent years there has been a growing demand for Western baby milk brands in China, largely driven by the growing middle class in the country and concerns over food safety. As a result, individual householders have purchased large quantities of baby milk in the UK and other countries, causing shortages and frustration for parents. The National Childbirth Trust (NCT) in the UK has expressed concern over the situation, stating that it is \"unacceptable\" that parents are struggling to access essential products for their babies. \"We understand that retailers are trying to prevent bulk buying, but we urge them to ensure that genuine customers are not unfairly penalized,\" said a spokesperson for the NCT. In addition, online marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay have also been accused of facilitating the bulk buying and the export of baby milk. A spokesperson for Amazon said that the company was \"working to prevent sellers of baby milk products from listing the bulk\" and that it was \"monitoring the situation closely\". The UK government was also drawn into the issue with the Department of Health saying it is \"aware of the concerns\" and is \"working with retailers and manufacturers to ensure that parents have access to the baby milk they need.\"Parents are advised to check with their local retailers for availability of baby milk products and, if necessary, to consider alternative brands.",

Then Mr. Walters allegedly used this information to make trades and also shared it with Mr. Mickelson who also made trades based on the information. The investigation centers on trades made in 2011 and 2012 involving shares of Clorox, a consumer goods firm. Mr. Icahn had attempted at the time to acquire Clorox and it is alleged that he shared information about his plans with Mr. Walters and Mr. Mickelson. Mickelson, a five-time Major winner and one of the most successful golfers of all time, has denied wrongdoing and said he is \"cooperating fully\" with the investigation. His lawyer Glenn Cohen released a statement that Mr. Mickelson has \"nothing wrong\" and is confident that he will be cleared of any wrongdoing. Icahn has also denied any wrongdoing and said that he always acted in accordance with the law. Mr. Walters has not publicly commented on the investigation.The investigation is ongoing, and it is unclear what penalties are the three men if they are found guilty of insider trading. Insider trading is a serious offense that can carry significant fines and even criminal charges. The news has sent shockwaves through the sports and business world, with many fans and investors expressing surprise and disappointment that Mr. Mickelson could be involved in such a scandal. The investigation, led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has been ongoing for several months and sources close to the case say that authorities have gathered significant evidence to support the allegations. According to insiders, the investigation began when authorities observed a series of unusual trades on Clorox shares in 2011 and 2012. The transactions, reportedly made through a series of complex transactions, produced significant profits for both men.As the investigation deepened, the authorities began to examine the relationships between Mr. Icahn, Mr. Walters and Mr. Mickelson.",

These elements, such as carbon, sulphur, nitrogen and hydrogen, were added later on by space rocks after Earth's core had finished forming. \"Any of those elements that fell to Earth in meteorites and comets more than about 100 million years after the Solar System formed could have avoided the intense heat of the magma ocean that covered Earth up to that point,\" said Yuan Li, from the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. \"The problem with that idea is that while it can account for the abundance of many of these elements, there are no known meteorites that would produce the ratio of volatile elements in the silicate portion of our planet. \"The group had previously published papers showing that if even if carbon had not vaporised into space when the planet was largely molten, it would have ended up in the metallic core of our planet - because the iron-rich alloys there have a strong affinity for carbon.But if this is the case, where did the carbon in the mantle and biosphere come from?The team used laboratory experiments that can recreate the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions that exist deep inside Earth and other rocky planets.The found that one scenario that could reconcile the discrepancies in the carbon-to-sulphur ratio and carbon abundance was an embryonic planet like Mercury colliding with and being absorbed by Earth, early in its history. \"Because it's a massive body, the dynamics could work in a way that the core of that planet would go directly to the core of our planet, and the carbon-rich mantle would mix with Earth's mantle,\" said Dr Dasgupta.",

        "text": "According to the team, the embryonic planet, often referred to as a \"planetary embryo\", would have formed in the early days of the solar system, about 4.5 billion years ago. These planetary embryos are thought to have been abundant in the solar system during its formative stages and would have been rich in volatile elements. The collision, which would have released an enormous amount of energy would have vaporized a large portion of the planetary embryo, releasing its volatile elements into the atmosphere. These elements would then have been incorporated into the mantle and crust of Earth, providing the necessary building blocks for life to emerge.The researchers used computer simulations to model the impact and found that it could have delivered up to 40% of the earth's total carbon content. They argue that this could have been sufficient to create the conditions needed for life to arise. \"This study offers a new perspective on the origin of life on Earth,\" said Dr. Sarah Stewart, lead author of the study. \"The delivery of volatile elements from a planetary embryo could have played a critical role in shaping the chemistry of the planet and ultimately the emergence of life. \"The findings of the team also have implications for the search for life beyond our planet. If the delivery of volatile elements by planetary embryos is a common process in the formation of planets, it could increase the likelihood of finding life elsewhere in the universe. Some scientists argue that the impact would have been too violent and would have stripped the Earth of its atmosphere, rather than delivering volatile elements. Despite these criticisms, the study provides a new and interesting perspective on the origins of life on Earth and highlights the complex and still poorly understood processes that shaped our earth's early history.",

Ingram told the inquest that a post-mortem examination revealed a number of injuries on Mr. McCollum's face and neck, including bruises, abrasions and petechial hemorrhages, which are small bleeding spots under the skin. These types of injuries are often associated with asphyxiation or strangulation, the doctor stated that while it was possible that some of the injuries could have been caused by accidental trauma such as falling out of bed, the sheer number and severity of the injuries suggested that something more sinister may have happened. \"I have to say that I am very concerned about the nature of these injuries,\" said Dr. Ingram. She is not consistent with a natural death and I believe further investigation is necessary to determine the cause of Mr. McCollum's death. The inquest also heard that the nursing home had been subject to several inspections and audits in the months leading up to Mr. McCollum's death and that while concerns had been raised about staffing levels and care practices, there was no indication of major issues. The police have launched an investigation into Mr. McCollum's death and the inquest has been adjourned pending the outcome of their inquiries. McCollum's family expressed shock and distress about his death and have called for a full and transparent investigation into the circumstances surrounding his passing. \"We just want to know what happened to Seamus,\" said his sister Margaret. \"He was a vulnerable person who relied on others for his care, and we trusted the nursing home to look after him.

It was a cruel blow for Kilmarnock who had defended valiantly throughout the match but fell short against the reigning champions. The Rogic moment of magic however proved to be the difference, and the Hoops will look to build on this victory when they face Hearts on April 2. For Kilmarnock, defeat is a setback in their bid to avoid being dragged into a relegation battle. Lee Clark's side remain eight points clear of Dundee United, but should quickly regroup for their next match. In the end it was a tale of two halves, with Celtic dominating possession in the first 45 minutes, but struggling to create clear-cut chances. Kilmarnock, on the other hand, grew into the game in the second half and could have taken the lead through Gary Dicker's effort but Celtic ultimately found the breakthrough thanks to Rogic's sublime strike. The Australian goal was a fitting winner and capped a hard-fought victory for the Celtics. As the final whistle blew, the Celtic players celebrated wildly knowing that they had secured a crucial three points. For Kilmarnock, defeat was a bitter pill to swallow, but they will need to dust off quickly before their next game.In the end, it was a match that had everything - drama, tension and a spectacular winner.

It suggested that manufacturers should be encouraged to reformulate their products to reduce sugar content, and that schools and workplaces should promote healthy eating habits. The Food and Drink Industry has responded to the report, saying that it is committed to reducing sugar content in its products and promoting healthier choices. The report has also expressed concern over the possible impact of a sugar tax on businesses and consumers. The findings have sparked a lively debate about the role of government in regulating food choices and promoting public health. While some argue that a sugar tax is a necessary measure to tackle the growing problem of obesity and related health issues, others believe that it is an overly simplistic solution that could have unintended consequences. Tedstone stressed that the recommendations are not about restriction of individual freedom, but rather about creating an environment that supports healthy choices. \"We're not saying that people can't have treats, but we need to make sure that the default option is a healthy one,\" she said. The government is expected to respond to the recommendations of the report in the coming weeks, and it remains to be seen whether a sugar tax in England will be introduced. However, with the findings of the report highlighting the urgent need for action on sugar consumption it is clear that the debate is far from over. In related news, health campaigners welcomed the findings of the report and are calling on the government to take bold action to tackle the problem of sugar consumption. \"This report is a wake-up call to the government to take action on sugar, said Simon Gillespie, CEO of the British Heart Foundation. \"We need a comprehensive approach that includes a sugar tax, clearer labelling and restrictions on the distribution of sugar to children.\"",

Why don't you ask Hillary as well? \"Mr Trump, who praised Ms Jones for her courage, called her \"a loser\" in a 1998 interview with NBC's Chris Matthews.The nursing home administrator claimed Mr Clinton raped her in an Arkansas hotel room in 1978 and Mrs Clinton helped him conceal it. \"Mr Trump may have said some bad words, but Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me. I don't think there's any comparison\", she said during the news conference on Sunday, referring to the New York businessman's sex boast tape.Ms Broaddrick served as a volunteer on Mr Clinton's first gubernatorial campaign.The former president has denied the allegation through a lawyer and no charges were ever filed.She spoke out in 1999 during an investigation of Mr Clinton by the independent counsel Kenneth Starr, recanting sworn testimony a year earlier stating the incident never happened.Over the weekend, Mr Trump tweeted an interview Ms Broaddrick gave to right-wing website Breitbart, in which she alleged that Mrs Clinton thanked her for her silence at a political rally.The former White House aide alleged Mr Clinton groped her in his office in 1993, but had previously said it never happened.Ms Willey said she had met with the former president to ask for a paying job to help with her family's financial struggles.Mr Clinton has also denied this claim and the Office of Independent Counsel found her allegations inconclusive. \"I think we can bring peace to this world, and I think Donald Trump can lead us to that point,\" she said at the news conference.Ms Shelton was the 12-year-old victim in a sexual assault case Mrs Clinton was appointed to early in her legal profession.Mrs Clinton was the attorney for a factory worker accused of raping Ms Shelton, despite her objections over the case.In audio recordings from the mid-1980s of an interview Mrs Clinton had with an Arkansas reporter, the current Democratic nominee is heard laughing while discussing the trial, including this instance when she says: \"Of course he [the defendant] claimed he didn't [rape her]â€¦ He took a lie detector test. I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs. \"Ms Shelton's attacker ultimately admitted a reduced charge, and she has since said Mrs Clinton put \"me through hell\".",

The women who appeared with Mr. Trump were Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and Juanita Broaddrick, all of whom have accused Mr. Clinton of sexual misconduct. The fourth woman, Kathy Shelton, was a 12-year-old victim in a rape case in which Mrs. Clinton defended the accused rapist as a lawyer in 1975.The move by Mr. Trump's campaign was seen as a desperate attempt to deflect attention from his own scandal and to attack Mrs. Clinton's character by association. Many critics argued that it was a misguided and offensive tactic which only served to embarrass Mr. Trump. The debate itself was marked by a tense and confrontational atmosphere, with both candidates trading barbs and insults. At one point, Mr. Trump repeatedly brought up the allegations against Mr. Clinton, while Mrs. Clinton focused on Mr. Trump's own behavior and the harm it could cause to women and girls. \"If I win, I'm going to instruct my Attorney General to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there have been a lot of lies, a lot of deceit and a lot of abuse of power.\" She responded, \"It is just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country. The debate was widely seen as one of the most contentious and divisive in presidential history, with both candidates engaging in personal attacks and refusing to back down. In the end, it was unclear whether either candidate had been victorious, but one thing was certain: The 2016 presidential election had reached a new level of uglyness and vitriol. As the debate came to a close, many pundits and analysts were shocked at the level of hostility and personal attacks by both candidates. The debate had devolved into a series of bitter exchanges, with each candidate trying to outdo the other in a game of political one-upmanship. Despite the controversy surrounding Mr. Trump's decision to raise the allegations against Mr. Clinton, many of his supporters praised the move, saying it was a necessary step to hold Mrs. Clinton accountable for her husband's actions. However, critics argued that it was a desperate and cynical ploy to distract Mr. Trump of his own scandals and controversies.The debate also saw both candidates debate on a range of policy issues, from healthcare and taxes to national security and immigration.",

But if he accepts, there will be no toss. \"The recommendation came from the ECB's cricket committee, which includes ECB chief executive Tom Harrison, England team director Andrew Strauss and former England coach Andy Flower.The committee's chairman, Peter Wright, said a decision on whether to extend the trial would be taken at the end of the 2016 season.Wright also said the decision was partly motivated about concern over the development of English spin bowlers. \"There has been concern for some years about some Championship pitches,\" he said. \"But it is fair to say that the plight of spin bowling in this country brought things into focus. \"Figures showing spinners bowled only 21.5% of the overs in the 2015 Championship were presented to the committee and we have come to the conclusion that the only way to bring spin bowlers more into the game is to provide better pitches for them to bowl on. \"On Wednesday, England's limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan said the move may benefit the game long-term. \"If it's to improve the standard of wickets that we play on, and potentially produce a couple of wickets where spin might be conducive to that particular ground, I think absolutely,\" he said. \"The benefit in county cricket might not be at the very beginning, but potentially for younger guys coming through - they'll develop different skills which will in turn give them a greater base, if they do get picked for England, to play around the world and do it successfully. \"But Andrew Gale, captain of County Champions Yorkshire, described the decision as \"absolute madness\".He added on social media: \"If the pitches are bad, why have no points been deducted in past few seasons? \"Meanwhile, the ECB also announced new helmet safety measures, on the eve of the first anniversary of Phillip Hughes' death.The Australia batsman died aged 25, two days after being struck on the top of the neck by a ball during a domestic match in Sydney, in November 2014.The ECB said the new measures will require all male and female cricketers to use helmets when batting.Wicketkeepers standing up to the stumps and fielders closer than eight yards to the batsman's middle stump, except behind the wicket on the off side, will also have to wear helmets.It said the recommendations followed a joint review by the ECB and the Professional Cricketers' Association, and were designed to reduce the risk of head and facial injuries within the game.",

The new rule which will come into force immediately is meant to encourage visiting captains to be proactive and bold in their decision-making rather than simply opting to bat first by default. With giving the opportunity to bowl first the ECB hopes to see more varied and exciting cricket, with teams more eager to take initiative and seize the momentum of the game.The change has been welcomed by many in the cricket community who believe it will lead to more competitive and unpredictable matches. \"This is a great move by the ECB,\" said Michael Vaughan, the former England captain. It will encourage captains to think more strategically and take more risks, which for fans can only lead to more exciting cricket. \"The ECB also announced that it will be monitoring the impact of the new rule and gathering feedback from players, coaches and spectators throughout the season. The governing body is committed to continually improving the game and ensuring that it remains entertaining and engaging for all involved. The first matches to be affected by the new rules are the first round of the county championship, which starts on April 8. Fans will be eagerly anticipating the start of the new season and the chance to see how this innovative change will shape the game. The ECB's decision to shake up the traditional toss rules has sparked a lively debate among cricket enthusiasts, with many hailing it as a bold and necessary move to revive the County Championship and Bob Willis Trophy.One of the key benefits of the new rule is that it will encourage teams to be more adaptable and responsive to changing conditions. By giving the visiting captains the option of bowling first, they will need to carefully consider the pitch, weather and the opposition before making their decision. This is expected to result in more nuanced and tactical cricket, when teams look to exploit any advantages they can gain. \"It is a great move by the ECB,\" said former England batsman Mark Ramprakash and the current coach of Surrey. It will add an additional layer of strategy to the game and captains will need to be more proactive and flexible in their decision making. It's a chance for them to show their skills and outsmart their opponents. The change is also seen as a way to reduce the dominance of the batting teams, which has been a feature of the County Championship in recent years.",

In addition to prepredicting the Arab Spring, the system also collected early clues about the location of Osama Bin Laden. By analyzing news articles from 2007 to 2011, the system was able to identify a cluster of reports mentioning the Pakistani city of Abbottabad which later revealed as the location of Bin Laden's hideout. \"This is not only about predicting revolutions,\" said Mr. Leetaru. \"This is about being able to identify patterns in large amounts of data which can help us to understand and anticipate a wide range of events, from natural disasters to economic crises. \"The system's ability to analyze large amounts of data quickly and accurately makes it a powerful tool for policymakers, researchers and journalists. By providing early warnings of potential conflicts or crises, the system could help prevent or mitigate their impact. Leetaru's research has implications beyond the field of conflict prediction. The system’s ability to analyze sentiment and location data could be used to track the spread of diseases, monitor the impact of climate change or identify emerging trends in business and technology. The findings of the study have sparked interest among governments, NGOs and private companies who see the potential for the system to provide valuable insights and early warnings.As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the ability to analyze and make sense of large amounts of data will become increasingly important.

The hosts, MK Dons, had a shot on the target throughout the entire game, but that was enough to seal the victory. Oldham Athletic who were desperate to climb out of the relegation zone were left frustrated by their inability to convert their limited chances into goals. Despite having more possession and territory, they were unable to find the back of the net. The best chance came in the first half when Aaron Amadi-Holloway opened a header over the far post. It was however MK Dons who finally broke the deadlock thanks to Maynard's magic moment.

This scenario is becoming all too familiar to paramedics like Kerry and Mark. They are increasingly filling the gaps in the healthcare system, providing care and support to vulnerable elderly patients like Irene, who are struggling to access basic services. \"We are not just ambulance drivers.

This shift in demand is putting a strain on the ambulance services, which are already stretched to the limit. The company is doing its best to respond to these calls, but it's clear that the system is broken,\" Kerry said, who has seen a significant increase in non-emergency calls over the past year. Instead of fixing symptomatic problems, we need a way to address the root causes of these issues. In Irene's case, Kerry and Mark were able to arrange for her to receive additional support from the social services, including a home visit from a district nurse and a referral to a local befriending service. It was a small victory, but one that highlighted the need for a more comprehensive approach to the care of the elderly. As the paramedics left Irene's home they could not help but wonder how many more patients were out there that were struggling to access the care they needed.

According to van der Hoeven, China's commitment to clean energy is often overlooked by the international community. \"China is heavily investing in renewable energy and its efforts are paying off. In fact, China is now the world's largest market for solar panels and wind turbines,\" she said. The IEA chief has highlighted that China's clean energy investments are not limited to renewable energy sources. China is also a world leader in electric vehicles, with many domestic manufacturers producing electric cars. The country is also making significant progress in energy efficiency with a focus on reducing energy consumption in buildings and the industry,\" explained van der Hoeven. The comments come as the world grapples with the challenges of climate change and sustainable development. The IEA is at the forefront of the promotion of clean energy and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and van der Hoeven's remarks are seen as a significant endorsement of China's efforts in this area. When asked about China's coal-fired power plants, van der Hoeven acknowledged that they still pose a significant environmental challenge. Nevertheless, she emphasized that China's state-of-the-art coal-fired power stations are a model for other developing countries. \"These power stations are equipped with the latest technology to reduce emissions and improve efficiency. They should be replicated in other countries to reduce the environmental impact of coal-fired power generation,\" she suggested. Van der Hoeven’s comments are likely to spark a renewed debate about China’s role in the global clean energy landscape. While some critics argue that China's clean energy efforts are overshadowed by its continued reliance on coal, others see the country as a leader in the transition to a low-carbon economy.

The agency attributes the spike to a combination of factors, including recent changes in immigration policies and an increase in organized smuggling operations. \"We are seeing a growing trend of individuals that attempt to exploit loopholes in the system,\" said a spokesperson for the agency. \"Our agents are working tirelessly to halt the flow, but it is clear that more needs to be done to address the root causes of this problem. The majority of those caught were from Central America countries, with many claimed to flee the violence and poverty in their home countries. However, officials noted that a significant number of individuals were also seeking to enter the country for economic reasons. The surge in border crossings has sparked renewed debate over immigration reform, with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle calling for more money for border security and more comprehensive solutions to address the root causes of migration.In response to the growing crisis, the government announced plans to deploy additional resources to the border, including more agents and surveillance technology. However, critics argue that a more nuanced approach is needed to address the factors driving migration and provides a safe and legal path for those seeking to enter the country. As the situation continues, a thing is clear: the issue of border security and immigration reform remain a pressing concern for policymakers and the public alike. The increase in border crossings has also raised concerns about the humanitarian situation, with reports of overcrowding and unsanitary conditions at detention facilities. Human rights groups criticized the government's response, saying that it is not doing enough to provide adequate care and support to those in custody. '' We are seeing a humanitarian crisis unfold at the border,'' said a spokesperson for a leading human rights organization. \"The Government's focus on enforcement and deterrence is only exacerbating the problem, and it is clear that a more compassionate and sustainable approach is needed. The issue has also sparked a heated debate over the use of detention facilities - some lawmakers calling for their closure and others arguing that they are necessary to ensure public safety.As the situation continues to unfold the government faces growing pressure to find a solution to the crisis. The president has announced plans to meet with lawmakers from both parties to discuss potential solutions, but it remains to be seen whether a bipartisan agreement can be reached. The situation at the border remains dreadful.",

Its anonymous nature means it is a popular choice for criminal activity as it is extremely difficult to trace who is spending Bitcoin.The currency's creator (or creators, perhaps) is proving just as difficult to trace.Wired cite leaked documents it says shows communication between Dr Wright and his lawyers in which he is reported to have said: \"I did my best to try and hide the fact that I've been running Bitcoin since 2009. \"By the end of this I think half the world is going to bloody know. \"I've tried to reach Dr Wright, but to no avail. His blog was taken offline shortly after Wired published its report, while Dr Wright's Twitter account went from being protected to being deleted altogether.According to the online profiles that remain online, he runs DeMorgan Ltd, a Sydney-based company that looks at \"alternative currency\".For the full break down of Wired's body of research into Dr Wright, I urge you to read their full article. But it can be summed up as:- Blog posts apparently published well before the launch of Bitcoin sharing and seeking expertise on creating cryptocurrencies.- A request for people to email him details by using an encrypted key previously linked to someone identifying themselves as being Satoshi Nakamoto.- A post announcing the launch of Bitcoin that was later deleted and replaced with a note saying \"the best way to hide is right in the open\".Furthermore, leaked emails and transcripts back up what the magazine says - pointing to Dr Wright having huge stashes of Bitcoins, which he among other things used to invest in setting up a Bitcoin bank.But, and it's a big but, Wired is quick to pre-emptively point out the potential holes in its theory - saying it could be a very elaborate hoax. \"The unverified leaked documents could have been faked in whole or in part,\" the magazine said.But later adds: \"But this much is clear: If Wright is seeking to fake his Nakamoto connection, his hoax would be practically as ambitious as bitcoin itself. \"The body of evidence presented is certainly compelling, and fills in many of the holes not covered by other supposed outings of the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, who is fast becoming something of a Lord Lucan for the digital world.Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC",

        "text": "Has Satoshi Nakamoto Now Finally Been Unmasked? **In a shocking revelation, Wired magazine claimed to have revealed the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic mastermind behind the creation of Bitcoin. According to the publication, Nakamoto is actually a 44-year-old Australian cryptologist named Craig Steven Wright. This bombshell announcement came on the heels of a similar claim made in 2014 by Newsweek which later was debunked and led to a lawsuit by the wrongly accused individual, Dorian Nakamoto. The debacle served as a cautionary tale for journalists and cryptocurrency enthusiasts alike, highlighting the dangers of jumping to conclusions and the importance of rigorous fact-checking. The magazine's investigation, which spanned several months, allegedly uncovered a trove of evidence that aims to be Wright's elusive Nakamoto. This includes emails, documents, and even a cryptic blog post from 2008 that appears to hint at Wright's involvement in the development of bitcoin. Wright has a background in computer science and has worked on various projects related to digital currencies. His expertise in cryptography and his familiarity with the underlying technology behind Bitcoin make him a plausible candidate for the role of Nakamoto, however the cryptocurrency community remains skeptical and many are calling for concrete proof before accepting Wright as the true Nakamoto. The pseudonymous nature of the creator of Bitcoin has led to a culture of anonymity and secrecy, making it hard to verify claims of identity. One thing remains certain as the news continues to unfold : the search for Satoshi Nakamoto has captured the imagination of the public and sparked a frenzy of speculation and intrigue. Whether Wright is actually the mastermind behind Bitcoin or just another false lead – one thing is clear – the mystery surrounding Nakamoto's identity continues to fascinate and intrigue us all. Stay tuned for further updates as this story continues to unfold. **The cryptocurrency community weighs in**As news of Wired's claim spread like wildfire, the cryptocurrency community was abuzz with reactions ranging from skepticism to excitement. Many experts and enthusiasts took to social media to share their thoughts — some calling for caution — and others hailing Wright as the long-sought Nakamoto. \"I've been following Craig Wright's work for years and I must say that the evidence presented by Wired is compelling,\" said Denver cryptocurrency analyst, Jackson Palmer. But we need to see more concrete proof before we can say for sure that he is Nakamoto. Other were more skeptical and cited the Newsweek Debakel as a cautionary tale. \"We've been down this road before, and it ended in shame,\" wrote bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen on his blog. When I see a cryptographic proof of Wright himself, I'll believe it. The search for Satoshi has been a long and winding one, filled with twists and turns.",

Not only did he win the trainers' title again - and to demonstrate his longevity this fourth one came 31 years after the first - but furthermore Altior indicated that he can indeed be the new Sprinter Sacre for the Henderson team.A good old fashioned British/Irish showdown between Altior and a hopefully-back-to-his-brilliant-best Douvan at next season's Cheltenham Festival is already being anticipated.At Sandown, meanwhile, Henllan Harri took a surprise win in the Bet365 Gold Cup in a thrilling finish.The 40-1 shot, trained by Peter Bowen and ridden by his son, Sean, made most of the running and held on from the Henderson-trained Vyta Du Roc, with Theatre Guide third. \"It's a tough game and, to be fair, we have been consistent over the last few years and we've second to Paul four or five times,\" said Henderson. \"I don't think I'm coming to the end of it, I will keep going as long as everybody wants me to. \"The popular Menorah, trained by Philip Hobbs, was retired after winning the Oaksey Chase at Sandown for the fourth successive year.",

We said we were going to come out and play. We knew we needed that game after England,\" he added. \"It's the learning you take from playing against the best team in the world and sometimes the learning takes place out in the middle. \"It doesn't matter what we do on the training field and as coaches, you've got to be out there in the middle and experience the relentlessness that the All Blacks bring. \"We feel like we get better the longer we are together.

The tourists will now regroup and refocus for the upcoming week with the Chiefs on Tuesday in Hamilton. The match against the Super Rugby franchise will however provide an opportunity for Gatland to rotate his squad and give some of his fringe players a run-out. The real test will come next Saturday when Wales face the All Blacks again in Wellington in the second test. If the Welsh are to have any hope of lining up the series, they need to regroup and find a way to contain the attacking threats of the All Blacks.Gatland has already suggested making changes to his starting lineup for the second test, with several players putting their hands up for selection with impressive performances off the bench. A player likely to come into contention is scrum-half Gareth Davies who sparked the Wales attack with his introduction in the second half. Despite the defeat, Wales can take heart from their first half performance which saw them fight against the All Blacks head for head. Until they can rediscover that level of intensity and cohesion, they may yet cause an upset in Wellington. But for now the focus is on bouncing back from a disappointing defeat and preparing for the challenges that lie ahead. The defeat marks Wales' 27th consecutive loss to the All Blacks on New Zealand soil, a streak which dates back to 1953. While tourists will be disappointed with the outcome, they can take solace in the fact that they pushed the World Champion to the limits for long periods of the match. One of the major positives to emerge from the game was the performance of Wales debutant wing Josh Adams. The 22-year-old scored a try on his international debut and looked dangerous every time he touched the ball.",

The incident occurred on April 1, 2014, when Keane Wallis-Bennett, a 12-year-old student at Liberton High School, died after the freestanding privacy wall in the changing rooms collapsed on him. The wall, which was approximately 2.4 meters tall and 1.2 meters wide, was not fixed to the floor and was designed to provide privacy for pupils changing for physical education classes. Investigation of the incident found that the wall was not properly secured and was prone to slipping. The determination stated that the walls unstable nature combined with innocent and excessive behavior of the pupils led to the tragic accident. The City of Edinburgh Council, which is responsible for the school, has expressed its condolences to Keane's family and has pledged to take steps to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. A spokesperson for the council said: \"Our foremost priority is the safety of our pupils and we will do everything in our power to prevent such a tragedy from happening again. The council has promised to review its safety protocols and to work with schools to ensure that all freestanding walls are properly secured and meet safety standards. The council will also provide additional training for school staff on safety procedures and emergency response protocols.Keane's family has welcomed the determination and called for schools to immediately take action to ensure that similar walls are properly secured. The family said in a statement: \"We hope that Keane's tragic death will not be in vain and that schools will take action to prevent such incidents from happening again. We will continue to fight for justice and to ensure that schools for all pupils are safe. The incident has raised concerns about school safety and the need for schools to review their safety protocols to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future.",

But as we have seen it with electric cars in the past, it is easier said than done. There are already concerns about a lack of hydrogen filling stations.And an equally big challenge will be producing them cheaply enough to keep them affordable for buyers.None of the carmakers has officially revealed the prices as yet, though some reports indicate that Toyota's FCV may cost between $50,000 and $100,000 (Â£31,000 to Â£62,000).The South Korean company has announced plans to start commercial sales of a fuel cell-powered version of its sports utility vehicle, the Tucson, in the US market.Honda Motor is also expected to unveil its latest concept version of a fuel cell-powered vehicle later this week.Many carmakers have been looking to develop the fuel cell technology further and bring it to mass production.One of the main reasons is that it is emission-free.The technology uses hydrogen to generate electricity to power the engine and the waste products are heat and water.At the same time, fuel cells charge much faster and travel a longer distance after being charged, compared with battery-operated electric cars.However, there are concerns over the demand for such vehicles, not least because there are not enough hydrogen filling stations.Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Nissan, said that worries over infrastructure were the key reason for his firm to put some of their plans on hold. \"Frankly, I don't know how they are going to do it, because knowing all the problems we have, to have a charging system with electricity, where is the hydrogen infrastructure?\" Mr Ghosn was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency. \"That's why we have postponed, in a certain way, some of our ambitions in terms of fuel cells.\"",

The concept car, unveiled at the Tokyo Motor Show, boasts an impressive range of 500 km on a full tank that can be refueled in just a few minutes. The announcement comes on the heels of Hyundai's announcement earlier this week that it plans to start mass production of fuel cell powered cars as early as next year. The South Korean automaker has invested heavily in fuel cell technology and has already featured its own fuel cell powered vehicle, the ix35 FCEV. The growing interest in fuel cell technology is driven by its potential to provide a zero emission alternative to traditional gas-powered cars. Fuel cells use hydrogen as fuel, which produces only water and heat as byproducts, making it an attractive option for environmentally conscious consumers. Toyota FCV concept car is powered by a fuel cell stack that is more compact and efficient than previous models. The company claims that the vehicle can be refueled in just three to five minutes, making it a viable option for daily driving.While there are still significant challenges to overcome, including lack of hydrogen refueling infrastructure, the announcement by Toyota is a significant step forward for the industry. The company has already begun testing fuel cell technology on public roads in Japan and plans to expand its testing into the US and Europe in the coming months. As the automobile industry aspires to more environmentally friendly options, it is clear that fuel cell technology will play a major role in the future of transportation. In the coming years, with Toyota and Hyundai leading the charge, it's likely we'll see more and more fuel cell cars hit the road. Industry experts hail the announcement of Toyota as a major breakthrough and credit the company's reputation for reliability and quality as a key factor in bringing fuel cell technology to the mainstream. \"Toyota's entry into the fuel cell market is a game-changer,\" said Dr. David Kim, a leading expert in alternative energy vehicles. Their commitment to produce a fuel cell car by 2015 will help to lower costs and increase adoption rates.",

Between the beginning of August and the end of February, the pound actually fell about 11% against the US dollar and 10% against the euro.How much of this was due to the referendum and how much was down to other factors?Well, the referendum date was not confirmed until 20 February, but it was widely expected to be announced.There was a pretty sharp fall in the value of the pound around the time of the announcement, as you can see from the graphs, although that particular dip was relatively short-lived.So, how much of the pound's fall was down to uncertainty surrounding a potential Brexit as opposed to factors such as interest rate expectations?As we have discussed before, predicting uncertainty cannot be seen as a controversial forecast, and it is generally accepted markets do not like uncertainty.So it is fair to say some of the fall in the pound has been due to the potential for Brexit - it is a factor that has been cited regularly in analysts' reports. The Office for Budget Responsibility cited some of the banks predicting weakness for the pound.But given the result of the referendum will have implications for the economy for decades to come, a bit of weakness in the pound ahead of the vote should not be seen as too worrying a factor.In particular, a weak pound is not a bad thing for everyone - it is good news for many exporters in the UK.Reality Check verdict: The referendum debate is likely to be one of the factors weakening the pound, but things like delayed interest rate rises are also responsible.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate",

The warnings come on the heels of similar warnings from other major economic organizations, including the World Bank and the OECD. All these organizations are alarming over the potential risks of a Brexit, including the possibility of recession, a decline in trade and investment and a decline in economic growth. But it is not only the economic organizations that are raising the alarm. Many business leaders and investors also express concerns about the potential impact of a Brexit on the economy. However, they point to the uncertainty and instability that a Brexit would create, and the potential for a decline in consumer confidence and business confidence. Many Brexit supporters remain undeterred. They argue that the UK would be better off outside the EU, free of the burdens of EU regulations and able to negotiate its own trade deals. They also point out the potential benefits of a Brexit, including the ability to control immigration and to make its own laws.As the debate about Brexit continues to heat up, it is clear that the economic consequences of a Brexit will be a major factor in the decision. The warnings from the IMF are only the latest in a series of warning statements from major economic organizations and are likely to be closely scrutinized by policymakers and voters alike. In the coming weeks and months, the Reality Check team will dig deeper into the economic consequences of a Brexit, examining the claims and counterclaims of both sides and providing an in-depth analysis of the potential risks and benefits. Stay tuned for more on this exciting story. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has added its voice to the growing chorus of concerns over the potential economic risks of a Brexit, warning that a Brexit could lead to a decline in trade and investment flows as well as the uncertainty and instability that would likely follow a UK exit from the EU.",

He has positioned himself as a more centrist alternative to Mr. Corbyn and won the support of many Labour MPs who are disillusioned with the left-wing shift of the party under Mr. Corbyn's leadership. In a speech earlier this week, Mr. Smith accused Mr. Corbyn of being out of touch with the concerns of ordinary Labour voters and promised to take the party in a more moderate direction. \"We need a leader who can unite the party and appeal to the wider electorate,\" he said. \"I believe I am the leader. However, despite Mr. Smith’s gains, Mr. Corbyn remains the favorite to win the leadership contest.",

Mobile operators are still unhappy with the new fees which they claim will lead to higher prices for consumers. \"This is a bad day for UK mobile customers,\" said a spokesperson for Vodafone. \"The significant increase in spectrum fees will inevitably result in higher prices for consumers and fewer investment in the mobile infrastructure. \"Ofcom, however, defended the price hike, saying that it reflected the true value of the spectrum. \"We have carefully analyzed the evidence and extensively consulted industry stakeholders,\" said a spokesperson for Ofcom The new fees are set at a level that reflects the value of this valuable public resource.

He also admitted paying off other women to keep them quiet.Writing to his successor, Risa Vetri Ferman, three months before criminal charges were filed, Mr Castor said: \"I can see no possibility that Cosby's deposition could be used in a state criminal case, because I would have to testify as to what happened, and the deposition would be subject to suppression. \"I cannot believe any state court judge would allow that deposition into evidence. ...Knowing this, unless you can make out a case without that deposition and without anything the deposition led you to, I think Cosby would have an action against the County and maybe even against you personally. \"It is now believed Mr Castor will be called by Mr Cosby's lawyers at a hearing on 2 February, where they will attempt to get the charge dismissed.But the current district attorney, Kevin Steele, said there is no evidence of a signed immunity agreement, which would have had to go through agreed channels.It was the decision of Mr Steele to bring criminal charges in December, before the statue of limitations ran out in January.Dozens of women have accused Mr Cosby of sexual assault, dating back to the 1970s, but only one charge has been brought because of the statute of limitations has passed on the majority of claims.",

They are seeking to have the case dismissed on the grounds that the prosecution violated the agreement agreed a decade ago.

According to Dr. Rachel Lowry, Chief Conservation Officer at the Chester Zoo, illegal wildlife trade is a major threat to many species, and it is essential that we take action to combat it. The Wildlife Witness app is a powerful tool that allows citizens to take a role in protecting wildlife and holding criminals accountable. The app has already seen success in South East Asia with several seizures of illegal wildlife products reported as a direct result of tips from the public. Conservationists hope to replicate this success and make a significant dent in the global illegal wildlife trade with the expansion to Europe and the United States. \"Illegal wildlife trade is a transnational problem that requires a global response,\" said Tom Hanscom, program manager at San Diego Zoo. By engaging with the public and providing them with a tool to report suspicious activities, we can create a network of wildlife witnesses that can help bring criminals to justice. The app is available for download on both iOS and Android devices and the users can submit reports anonymously. The developers also are working to integrate the app with existing law enforcement systems to make it easier for authorities to track and prosecute illegal wildlife traders. As illegal wildlife trade continues to pose a significant threat to many species, the launch of the Wildlife Witness app is a welcome development in the fight against this lucrative and destructive industry. Conservationists hope to create a sea of support for wildlife protection by empowering citizens to take action and to end the senseless slaughter of iconic animals like tigers and rhinos.",

The government needs to rethink this project and consider the devastating impact it will have on communities and businesses across the country. The controversy around HS2 has been ongoing, with critics arguing that the benefits of the project do not outweigh its costs and environmental impact. Supporters on the other hand, argue that the high-speed rail link is essential for the UK's economic growth and will reduce travel times between major cities. A thing remains clear: the engineering work required for HS2 will have a significant impact on the UK rail network and passengers and businesses alike will be affected.",

The incident has also raised questions about the importance of knowing basic first aid techniques such as the Heimlich maneuver, which can be lifesaving in emergency situations. Heimlich's actions have been praised as heroic and he has been praised for his quick thinking and selflessness. The incident serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of being prepared in emergency situations and the impact that one person can have on another's life. The dramatic rescue also sparked renewed interest in the Heimlich-manifest, with many people taking to social media to express their gratitude to Dr. Heimlich for his invention and to share their own stories of how the technique helped them or a loved one. \"I was once choking on a piece of food in a restaurant and a stranger performed the Heimlich maneuver on me,\" tweeted one Twitter user. \"I owe my life to this person and Dr. Heimlich for inventing the technique.

His courage and quick thinking are an inspiration for us all. The incident has also prompted many to consider the importance of learning basic first aid techniques, such as the Heimlich maneuver, CPR and the use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs ).

Go somewhere with a low horizon, away from obstructions like tall buildings.He says there is an optical illusion when the Moon is low on the horizon that makes it look bigger.For the perfect snap, Nasa photographer Bill Ingalls suggests using a reference point: \"Don't make the mistake of photographing the Moon by itself with no reference to anything,\" he says.He also advises scouting locations a day or two in advance and, if you are using a digital SLR, using a daylight white balance setting to capture moonlight.Supermoon photography (Nasa)To observers, the differences between a supermoon and a normal full moon are quite subtle.Generally, supermoons can be up to 14% larger and 30% brighter, but only when compared with the furthest point the Moon gets to within its orbit. \"These differences are pretty small, and with the Moon rising so high in the sky, as it does in the winter months, it'll be quite hard to notice any difference without comparing photographs,\" Dr Chris North told The Conversation website. \"But regardless of how big and bright it looks, the Moon really is a beautiful object to look at. \"However Neil de Grasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York, has previously suggested the events are just a little bit over-hyped. \"I don't know who first called it a supermoon,\" he told StarTalk radio. \"I don't know, but if you have a 16-inch pizza, would you call that a super pizza compared with a 15-inch pizza? \"Skywatchers in Australia were disappointed when thick clouds obscured their view of the Moon, which made a short-lived evening appearance.At Bondi Beach in Sydney, the Moon rose at around 19:07 AEDT (08:07 GMT). \"It did not meet my expectations.

The number of leavers entering employment has fallen from 24.4% last year to 23.4% this year. The Scottish Government has faced criticism over its handling of education, with concerns about the impact of curriculum changes and the role of standardized tests in schools. The latest figures are likely to add to the pressure on the government to take action to address the attainment gap and to improve outcomes for Scotland's young people. Also Scottish Conservatives weighed in on the issue, with their education spokesperson Liz Smith saying: \"These figures are a damning indictment of the SNP education record and a clear sign that their policies are failing our young people. The fact that the number of school leavers going to positive destinations is rising while the number of unemployed school leavers is a stark reminder of the challenges we face in our education system. \"On the other hand, the Scottish Greens took a more nuanced approach, with their education spokesperson, Ross Greer, saying: \"While it is welcome to see some progress in certain areas, such as increasing the numbers of school leavers from poorer areas achieving at least one higher, the overall picture remains one of concern.",

But there can be a negative aspect,\" she said. \"Heads of studios will use a few high profile cases to say we're doing our part or to say that there is a problem of under-employment, just not at their studio. It's a double-edged sword. \"In May, the American Civil Liberties Union in Southern California sent letters asking federal and state civil rights agencies to investigate the systemic failure to hire women directors at all levels of the film and television industry.In October, it was reported that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the US had begun contacting female directors to investigate gender discrimination in Hollywood.The gender gap in Hollywood pay also took centre stage last year after Jennifer Lawrence wrote an essay about unequal pay.Lauzen's report also showed films with women in the directing chair opened the door to women in other roles behind the scenes.Films that had at least one female director (including assistant directors), employed more women as writers, editors, and cinematographers than films with exclusively male directors.On films with at least one woman director, women made up 53% of writers compared to 10% if the directors were exclusively men.In a similar comparison, women comprised 32% of editors, compared to 19% if the directors were male.Historically, the report showed that while the percentage of directors has remained the same since 1998, the percentages of executive producers, producers, editors, and cinematographers have increased.However, in the same time the percentage of women writers has declined from 13% to 11%.The report showed that in 2015 women fared best in Hollywood as producers - making up 26% of posts.

The study's author, Dr. Martha Lauzen, expressed her disappointment at the lack of progress in improving female representation behind the camera. \"It's disheartening to see that, despite the increased attention to gender inequality in the film industry, we are not seeing any significant changes,\" she said. The report also highlights the lack of diversity among women working in key positions. For example, 4% of directors, writers and producers made up women of color while just 2% of the totals were over the age of 50 years old. The study's findings are particularly disturbing given the significant impact that women have had on the film industry in recent years. Films with female leads and directors have consistently outperformed their male counterparts at the box office and received widespread critical acclaim. Industry experts point out a range of factors contributing to the lack of progress, including unconscious bias, a lack of opportunities for women to gain experience and develop networks and a culture of sexism and misogyny. It is time for the industry to take concrete steps to address this problem,\" said Dr. Lauzen. \"We need to see a commitment to hiring more women in key positions and providing opportunities for them to develop their skills and to build their careers.

But expenditure has not kept up with a growing state prison population, which saw a rise of 343% between 1980 and 2013, although it has now declined slightly.Mr Gibson-Light said staff and inmates at the prison he visited said the amount of food being provided had decreased steadily over decades and warned the shift could have serious implications. \"Prisoners are so unhappy with the quality and quantity of prison food that they receive that they have begun relying on ramen noodles - a cheap, durable food product - as a form of money in the underground economy,\" he said. \"The form of money is not something that changes often or easily, even in the prison underground economy; it takes a major issue or shock to initiate such a change,\" he added.He called for more research into what the reduction in food could mean for the care of prisoners.",

The decline in culinary standards was attributed to a number of factors, including rising food costs, increased competition and a shortage of skilled chefs. It seems that many restaurants are attempting to maintain high standards in the face of these challenges. We see a lot of restaurants cutting corners to save money,\" said Sarah Johnson, the food critic and lead researcher on the study. This can manifest in a number of ways, from using lower-quality ingredients to reducing portion size. It's a trend that has a significant impact on the dining experience. \"The study also found that diners are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the value for money offered by many top restaurants. With prices continuing to rise, many consumers find that they are not getting the quality they pay for. \"It's not about the food\" said Johnson. It's about overall experience. If you pay top dollar for a meal you expect to be impressed. And right now, many restaurants are just not delivering. The findings of the study are likely to send shockwaves across the culinary world and may prompt many restaurants to examine their menus and business practices. As the industry continues to evolve, one thing is clear: Diners are demanding more and restaurants will have to step up their game to meet their expectations. The surveys results have sparked a heated debate within the culinary community, with many chefs and restaurateurs defending their establishments and others acknowledging the need for change. \"I think it's unfair to generalize that all high-end restaurants are cutting corners\", said chef Thomas Brown, the owner of the Michelin-starred restaurant Bistro Bliss. \"We're still committed to using only the freshest, highest-quality ingredients and our customers appreciate the attention to detail we bring to every dish. \"However, others in the industry admit that the findings of the survey are not entirely surprising. \"The reality is the cost of doing business is going up and it is getting harder to keep profits,\" said restaurateur Mark Davis.",

Leyton Orient secured a convincing 3-0 victory over Colchester United thanks to a dominant performance at the Colchester Community Stadium. The O's started to a flying start, with Jay Simpson scoring his first goal of the game in the 10th minute. Simpson's low and hard shot past Sam Walker gave the visitors an early lead and they never looked back.Colchester struggled to create clear-cut chances, with Kurtis Guthrie blazing at the bar and Sam Walker denying Simpson a second goal before the break. The U goalkeeper was again called into action in the second half but was powerless to stop Nicky Hunt's cocked shot from finding the back of the net. The game was all but over when Simpson scored his second goal of the game, unleashing a fierce shot from outside the area that flew past Walker and into the net. The Orient striker capped an impressive individual performance and sealed three points for his side. Leyton Orient move up to 10th in the League Two table while Colchester United remain 14th place. The U's will be looking to bounce back from this defeat when they travel to Yeovil Town next weekend, while Orient will be hoping to build on this momentum when they play Exeter City.

This significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy could lead to better outcomes for pregnant women and their babies. According to the researchers, the use of MRI scans could also reduce the number of unnecessary terminations, as some abnormalities detected by ultrasound may not be as severe as originally thought. In addition, the scans could provide valuable information for parents and allow them to make informed decisions about their pregnancy.The study's lead author, Dr. Paul Griffiths, stated that the MRI scans can provide a much more detailed picture of the developing brain which can help doctors to identify abnormalities earlier and more accurately. This could lead to better outcomes for babies and their families. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) welcomed the findings of the study and said that MRI scans could become a \"game-changer\" for prenatal care. The RCOG calls for MRI scanning to become a routine part of the prenatal care, especially for women who have a higher risk of brain abnormalities in their babies. Although the results are promising, there are still some limits to consider. MRI scans are more expensive and time-consuming than ultrasound and may not be available in all hospitals. However, the researchers believe that the benefits of MRI scans outweigh the costs and could ultimately lead to better outcomes for pregnant women and their babies. As the technology continues to evolve, it's likely that MRI scans will become an increasingly important tool in prenatal care.

As technology continues to evolve, it will be important to weigh its potential benefits against its potential risks. As the technology advances, it's likely that we'll see more sophisticated applications emerge.

This could revolutionize the way we consume audiobooks and make the experience more immersive and engaging.The potential risks associated with this technology cannot be ignored. The ability to manipulate people's words and create fake videos or audio recordings raises serious concerns about the spread of misinformation and propaganda. In an era where deepfakes and fake news are already causing serious damage, the last thing we need is another tool that can be used to fool and manipulate.

The changes will only apply to new backless seats and not ones already on the market that meet current safety standards.Parents can continue to use their current model after the rule change and will not need to buy a new one.It will be down to manufacturers of new seats to ensure they meet the revised safety standards and are labelled correctly.Children must use a child car seat until they are 12 years old or 135cm (4ft 5in) tall, whichever comes first.There are typically three types of children's car seats:Only EU-approved child car seats can be used in the UK - which have a label showing a capital \"E\" in a circle.Parents should typically choose a car seat based on their child's height or weight.A driver can be fined up to Â£500 if a child under 14 does not wear a seat belt or child restraint. Anyone 14 and over not wearing a seat belt must pay the fine themselves.There are exceptions. For example, children can travel without a child car seat in a taxi or minicab if they travel on a rear seat and wear an adult seat belt if they are aged three or older or without a seat belt if they are under three.Many parents think they can judge which car seat they need to buy based on their child's age but it should only be used as guidance.Car seats are typically categorised according to height and weight.Height-based car seats, known as \"i-Size\" seats, must be rear-facing until the child is over 15 months old.For weight-based car seats, the type depends on how heavy a child is.A more detailed list is available through childcarseats.org.uk",

The new guidelines replace the previous requirements that allowed children as light as 30 pounds (14 kilograms) and as short as 38 inches (97 centimeters) to use these seats. The revised regulations are designed to ensure that children are properly positioned and secured in their vehicle seats, reducing the risk of injury or death in the event of a crash. According to NHTSA data, motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death among children in the United States, with improperly used or installed car seats contributing to many of these tragedies.The changes are based on research and testing conducted by the NHTSA which revealed that children who are too small or too light for backless booster seats may not be adequately protected in the event of a crash. The agency has worked closely with manufacturers, safety experts and advocacy groups to develop the new guidelines that are expected to have a significant impact on child safety on the road. Parents and caregivers are advised to regularly check their child's weight and height to ensure they meet the new requirements for backless booster seats. Children who do not meet the new criteria should continue to use a forward-facing car seat with a harness until they reach the maximum weight or height limit of their seat. The NHTSA has also launched a public awareness campaign to educate parents and caregivers on the importance of proper car seat use and the new guidelines for backless booster seats. The agency is encouraging all parents to take the time to review the new regulations and ensure that their child is securely secured in their car seat. Parents can visit the NHTSA website for more information on new regulations and car seat safety or consult a certified child passenger safety technician. **New Guidelines for Backless Booster Seats Aim to Reduce Child Fatalities on the Road**In a move to enhance child safety on the roads, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has published revised guidelines for the use of backless booster seats.

This approach, often called the old boys network, can lead to a lack of diversity in terms of gender, ethnicity and social background as well as a limited range of skills and experiences. The study found that only 22% of companies externally advertise board roles while 45% rely on internal candidates or word of mouth.The EHRC warned that this approach can result in a lack of fresh perspectives and ideas, ultimately affecting business performance and contributing to the persistent gender and ethnicity pay gaps in the UK. The Commission is calling on companies to adopt more transparent and inclusive recruitment practices to ensure that boardrooms reflect better the diversity of the UK population. \"Companies need to move away from relying on who they know and focus instead on what they need,\" said Rebecca Hilsenrath, Chief Executive of EHRC. \"By opening up their recruiting processes and actively seeking out diverse candidates, businesses can tap into a wider range of skills and experiences, leading to better decision-making and improved performance. The findings of the study have sparked concerns among diversity campaigners, who argue that the lack of transparency in boardroom recruitment is a major obstacle to achieving greater diversity and inclusion in the corporate sector of the UK. \"This research highlights the need for a more systematic approach to boardroom recruitment,\" said Sophie Walker, CEO of Diversity and Inclusion Companies must recognize that their recruitment practices are not merely a matter of internal policy, but have a direct impact on the wider social and economic landscape.

The report says many poor households in these countries have also been hit by higher prices of imported goods, resulting from sharp declines in national currencies.The report warns: \"Even the limited gains in poverty reduction made over the past decade could rapidly reverse. \"It's worth adding that the growth figures for the world and for groups of countries reported by the bank should not be directly compared with the figures given by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).That's because there are two ways of adding up country figures, and the two agencies choose to highlight different ones.But comparable figures are there to be found.

The chief economist of the bank warned that these risks could potentially derail the fragile recovery and that policymakers must be vigilant and take steps to address these challenges. In terms of regional growth, the report predicts that East Asia and the Pacific will grow at a rate of 6.3% this year, driven by China's gradual deterioration and a rebound in Indonesia. The Middle East and North Africa are forecast to grow at a rate of 1.5%, while Latin America and the Caribbean are expected to grow at a rate of 2.5%. The report also emphasizes the need for policymakers to focus on structural reforms to boost productivity and growth. It indicates that investments in education, health care and infrastructure are crucial for the promotion of economic growth and the reduction of poverty.Overall, while the World Bank report offers some positive news, it also serves as a reminder that the global economy still faces substantial challenges and uncertainties. As such, policymakers will need to remain cautious and take steps to address these risks to promote sustainable and inclusive growth.

There were pent-up emotions to be released, and the quality of the game suffered from the raucous surroundings.There was excitement and zeal as the two sets of players hared around the Ibrox pitch, but not enough self-control to bring some poise to the proceedings.Rangers had the most cause to rue that lack of restraint, since they should have opened the scoring when Dean Shiels was sent through on goal. The forward hurried his finish, though, and scuffed the ball wide.It became a galling miss for Rangers, because minutes later a hopeful Gavin Gunning header sent Armstrong clear.Nadir Ciftci was returning from an offside position but was deemed not to be interfering with play and Armstrong took advantage of the confusion to clip a shot past Simonsen that kissed a post before nestling in the net.A pattern was established, since Rangers had the better patches of play, but could not influence the outcome.When Fraser Aird was free in the area, he laid the ball back to Jon Daly, only for the striker to direct a shot rashly over the bar.Moments later, Richard Foster failed to clear his lines and allowed Ryan Gauld to burrow into the Rangers penalty area before shunting into the path of Armstrong. He could not connect cleanly and neither, subsequently, could Mackay-Steven, but the ball looped off Bilel Mohsni, over Simonsen, and into the net.Smith restored some hope for Rangers with a free-kick that squeezed between Radoslaw Cierzniak and the base of his left-hand post.That goal came just before half-time and, athough Rangers continued to enjoy greater possession after the interval, their frailties could not be disguised.Mohsni was often hapless in possession, attacks were intermittent and haphazard in nature, and there was not enough link-up play between the midfield and the forwards.United's midfield struggled to retain possession, and their defence often sat too deep, but their four front players were a constant threat, not least because of the calamities that the Rangers defence were capable of.When Foster broke up one move and passed back to Simonsen, the goalkeeper hesitated before stubbing the ball straight at Ciftci. The striker rounded the stricken goalkeeper and was celebrating even before he rolled the ball into the empty net.Rangers restored something of their reputation with this display, but United were the more clinical side.",

Armstrong's clever movement and finishing ability allowed him to capitalize on a defensive mistake and he slotted the ball with ease past Simonsen.Gary Mackay-Steven doubled United's lead just before halftime, his shot taking a deflection off a Rangers defender to leave Simonsen with no chance. The Ibrox side did manage to keep one back by Steven Smith's well-taken free-kick but it was a rare moment of joy for Rangers fans.Any hopes of a Rangers comeback were shattered when Nadir Ciftci capitalized on a Simonsen error to score United's third goal. The goalkeeper's poor clearance fell to Ciftci, who rushed the ball gently into the empty net. Despite their best efforts, Rangers were unable to find a way back into the match and United saw the remaining minutes with relative ease. The win sets up a mouth-watering Scottish Cup final against either Aberdeen or St Johnstone and Jackie McNamara's side will be confident of winning the trophy after this impressive display.The defeat for Rangers marks a disappointing end to a season that had promised so much. Ally McCoist's side had been attempting to end their trophy drought, but instead they will have to wait another year to try and take some silverware. The victory was a sweet one for Dundee United, who had been written off by many as underdogs entering the match. Jackie McNamara's side proved her doubters wrong, producing a performance that was both disciplined and clinical. \"We are absolutely delighted with the win,\" McNamara said at his post-match press conference. \"We knew that it was going to be a tough game, but the boys were fantastic from start to finish. We worked hard, we were organized, and we took our chances when they came to us. Unlike many defenders in the industry, McNamara was especially pleased with the way his team defended : \"We knew Rangers had some quality players, but we nullified their threat and limited their chances. Our back four were outstanding and our goalkeeper made some crucial saves when it mattered. For Rangers, defeat was a bitter pill to swallow. The side of Ally McCoist had been aiming to end their trophy drought, but instead they must wait another year to try and bring some silverware up. \"We're extremely disappointed,\" McCoist said.",

At the time of his death he was one of only 25 men in the history of cricket to reach a hundred hundreds.Graveney's nephew David followed his father and uncle in captaining Gloucestershire, and was England's chairman of selectors during their 2005 Ashes success.",

His maiden century came in 1949, and he was billed as a potential England player in the early 1950s. The call-up finally came in 1951 when Graveney made his Test debut against South Africa at Trent Bridge. Although he failed to impress in his first few appearances, he eventually found his feet with a century against India in 1952 at Old Trafford. Graveney's test career was however marked by inconsistency and a perceived inability to convert his county form into international success. He was dropped from the team on several occasions and it wasn't until his 1966 recall that he really began to flourish.Graveney's second wind was largely credited to his move to Worcestershire in 1964, where he formed a powerful partnership with the likes of Basil D'Oliveira and Norman Gifford. His 258 against West Indies at the Oval in 1957 remained one of his highlights of the career, but it was his performances in the late 1960s that truly cemented his legacy. Graveney became the first player to score 1,000 runs in a season for the 10th time and his 44.38 average from 79 Tests remains one of the highest among English batsmen. He was also an integral part of the Worcestershire team who won the 1965 and 1964 County Championships.Graveney's retirement from cricket in 1972 was met with widespread acclaim and was appointed an OBE in 1973 for his services in this game. He went on to become a respected commentator and journalist, known for his insightful analysis and dry wit. Tom Graveney passed away at the age of 88, leaving behind a legacy as one of England's greatest players and a true cricket legend.",

The pilot began in response to growing concerns about classroom disruption and teacher safety and aims to deter misbehavior and provide evidence in cases of abuse or assault. Each participant in the trial will wear the cameras during the lessons, capturing footage of any incidents that may occur. A teacher who wished to remain anonymous spoke candidly of the challenges they face daily. They say: \"Unfortunately, there is usually a problem pupil in most classes. \" They can be very disruptive, compelled to follow instructions and even physically aggressive. It is not just about discipline; it's about creating a safe learning environment for everyone. \"Proponents of the Body Camera initiative argue that it will not only reduce the number of incidents, but also help to identify and address underlying issues contributing to pupil misbehavior. By providing a visual record of events, the cameras can also help to resolve disputes and to protect teachers from false accusations. However, critics have raised concerns about the potential impact on teacher-pupil relationships and the stigma associated with the use of body cameras. Some argue that the move could create a sense of mistrust and undermine the authority of educators.As the trial gets underway, educators, policymakers and parents will be watching closely to see if this innovative approach can help restore order in the classroom and guarantee a safer, more supportive learning environment for all. **Was think you?

The scene was quite disorienting\", said DI Evans. It was clear that Reverend Bevan had been living in squalid conditions with no signs of anyone ever having checked him for a long time. Inquest hears that Reverend Bevan, a retired Church of Wales minister, had been living alone at his home since his wife's death in 2015. Neighbors reported that he had become increasingly reclusive in the years leading up to his death, rarely leaving his house and relying on food deliveries and occasional visits by a local care worker. Coroner Sarah Riley weighed in with a verdict of accidental death citing dehydration and malnutrition as the causes. She also expressed concern about the lack of support and care provided to Reverend Bevan in the last years of his life. \"This is a tragic case that highlights the importance of checking into our elderly neighbors and ensuring they have access to the care and support they need,\" said Coroner Riley. The death of Rev. Bevan is a reminder that we all have a responsibility to look out for one another, especially those who may be vulnerable or isolated. The findings of the inquest have inspired calls for a greater awareness and action to address the issue of social isolation among the elderly in the community.

The controversy surrounding Lord Brittan's name has been ongoing since 2014, when a dossier compiled by the late MP Geoffrey Dickens was handed to the Home Office, alleging child abuse by prominent figures including Lord Brittan. However, in October the Metropolitan Police announced that they would continue the investigation into the alleged rape in a statement, accusing him of making \"unfounded accusations\" against his brother. In his blog post Mr. Watson has defended his actions, stating that he had only wanted to ensure that allegations were thoroughly investigated. \"I understand that the investigation is now concluded by police and respect that decision\" he wrote. But I do not believe it is wrong to have wanted the allegations to be properly investigated and for the police to have had the opportunity to decide whether there was a case to answer. The row has sparked a wider debate on the handling of historical child abuse allegations and the role of politicians in spouting out about such cases. Watson's apology for the distress caused to the Brittan family has been welcomed by some, but others have criticized him for not getting far enough in acknowledging his role in the affair. The controversy is likely to continue with many calling for greater clarity on the handling of historical abuse allegations and the role of politicians in speaking out about such cases.",

The revenue from its Macau operations has been declining steadily for the last year, as the Chinese government's anti-corruption campaign has led to a significant decrease in high-roller traffic in the region's casinos. As a result, the shares of the company have taken a hit of more than 20% in the last 12 months. Packer's potential bid to take Crown private has been the subject of much speculation in the last weeks. With his significant stake in the company, he would need to secure the financing to acquire the remaining shares, a move that could be costly and complex. Industry insiders suggest that Mr. Packer may be looking to restructure the company and reduce its debt, which has been a major concern for investors. Taking the company private could also give him more flexibility to make strategic decisions without having to be accountable to shareholders. However, any potential bid would need approval from regulators and would likely face scrutiny by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). The company's board also would have to consider any offer and make a recommendation to shareholders.In a statement, Crown said that Mr. Packer’s resignation from the board was immediately effective and he would not have any role in the company’s operations. The company's shares were flat during early morning trade as investors digested the news and awaited further developments. The move is the latest in a series of high profile departures from the Crown management team and has raised questions about the company’s future direction and strategy.",

Farsier McKevitt, Chief of Retail and Consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, noted that the intense competition among supermarkets has driven prices down, resulting in a 0.4% drop in grocery prices over the past 12 weeks. This is the lowest level of grocery inflation since Kantar began tracking prices in October 2006. The decline in sales value is largely attributed to the price war as supermarkets struggle to attract and retain customers in a highly competitive market. McKevitt stated: \"The fight to attract customers has sparked a price war which benefits shoppers, but is put pressure on the bottom lines of supermarkets. Despite the decline in sales value, some supermarkets managed to reverse the trend. Aldi and Lidl, the German discounters, have continued to grow their market share, with Aldi seeing a 10.6% increase in sales over the last 12 weeks. This growth is largely driven by their ability to offer lower prices on groceries, which is resonating with price-conscious consumers  In contrast, the big four supermarkets - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - all experienced a decline in sales over the last 12 weeks. The UK's largest supermarket, Tesco, saw a 2.5% decline in sales, while Sainsbury's experienced a 1.8% drop. The Kantar Worldpanel data also revealed that the online grocery store is continuing to grow with sales increasing by 6.5% over the past 12 weeks. Increasing interest in online shopping is expected to continue as more consumers turn to online shopping for convenience and to avoid the hassle of in-store shopping.In general, the latest data from Kantar Worldpanel highlights the intense competition in the grocery market, with supermarkets fighting to attract and retain customers in a highly competitive environment. As the price war continues, consumers will likely benefit from lower prices, but supermarkets will need to find ways to maintain profitability in a challenging market.",

The Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) welcomed the proposal and said it would be a \"major step forward\" for workers' rights. \"Working long hours can be devastating for workers' physical and mental health and it is about time we started taking their well-being seriously\", said STUC General Secretary Roz Foyer. We've seen time and again how excessive working hours can cause accidents, mistakes and burnout. This proposal would help to create a safer, healthier and more productive workforce. However, the Scottish Chambers of Commerce expressed concerns about the potential impact on businesses, primarily small and medium enterprises. \"While we understand the importance of protecting workers’ rights, we need to be careful not to impose unnecessary burdens on businesses,\" said Scottish Chambers of Commerce President, Liz Cameron.",

He added his next move would be a \"big one\". \"This is very good news,\" he said in a statement obtained by celebrity website TMZ.Production on Two and a Half Men was officially halted in late February after the 45-year-old actor insulted Chuck Lorre, the show's producer and co-creator, in several interviews.The actor had a contract with Warner Bros that ran to the end of the 2012 television season, providing him with $2m (Â£1.2m) per episode.Sheen said last week he was being paid too little and demanded an increase to $3m per show.Over the past few weeks, Sheen has given a series of often angry, rambling media interviews. He insists he is drug-free after undergoing rehabilitation in January.The actor was taken to hospital in Los Angeles in January with severe abdominal pains before entering rehab.He filed for divorce from his third wife, Brooke Mueller, in November, citing irreconcilable differences.Meanwhile, Sheen posted a message on the micro-blogging website Twitter early on Monday, searching for an intern to assist him in his work.The tweet, posted prior to Warner Bros's announcement, was a paid-for endorsement from the website Internships.com. \"I'm looking to hire a winning INTERN with TigerBlood,\" Sheen's message said.The actor has used social media websites to comment on the dispute between himself and the show's producers.It took him roughly 24 hours to reach 1 million followers on Twitter - a record for the website.",

The studio said in a statement that it was in the best interest of the film and all parties involved to separate with the actor. We are committed to upholding the highest standards of respect and inclusiveness and we will not tolerate behavior that contradicts these values. \"The film, which was due to be released in just a few weeks, is now facing an uncertain future. The studio has not yet announced whether it will recast the role or delay the release of the movie.The actor's representatives have so far declined to comment on the situation, but sources close to the production say that the actor is \"devastated\" by the decision and exploring his options for appeal. The controversy has sparked a heated debate in the entertainment industry, with many calling for greater accountability and consequences for actors who engage in offensive behavior. Others expressed concern about the potential impact of the film on cast and crew, who may be unfairly affected by the studio's decision.As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the entertainment industry is facing a moment of reckoning and the consequences of one's actions are more deeply felt than ever before. Industry insiders are already speculating about the potential impact from the studio's decision, with some forecasting a ripple effect across the industry. \"This is a wake-up call for actors and studios alike,\" said one expert in the industry. \"The days of getting away with offensive behavior are over. The public is demanding accountability and the studios are finally beginning to listen to it. The controversy also sparked a larger discussion about the role of social media in re-training celebrities. The actor's offensive remarks were first posted on social media and it was the subsequent online backlash that ultimately led to the studio's decision. \"Social media gave a voice to marginalized communities and created a platform for people to speak out against injustice,\" said a social media expert. It is no longer possible for celebrities to make offensive comments and expect them to go unnoticed.",

The tours being dropped include visits to zoos in Africa and Asia, where animals are often kept in small enclosures with inadequate care and conditions of living. Instead, Responsible Travel will focus on offering wildlife holidays that promote conservation and allow tourists to observe animals in their natural habitats. Francis emphasized that the decision was not lightly taken, but he believes that it is essential to raise awareness about the treatment of animals in zoos and to support more humane and sustainable tourism practices. \"We want to encourage our customers to think critically about the impact of their travel choices and to support tourism that benefits local communities and respects animal welfare,\" said he. Responsibility Travel has been praised by animal welfare organisations and conservation groups, who have long fought against the mistreatment of animals in zoos. \"This is a bold move by Responsible Travel and we hope it inspires other tour operators to follow suit,\" says Sarah Jones, Director of the Wildlife Matters charity. \"It's time for the tourism industry to take a stand against animal cruelty and to promote more responsible and sustainable practices. The move is also expected to have a positive impact on the tourism industry as a whole as more travelers become aware of the importance of responsible travel and seek out operators that share their values. \"We believe that tourism can be a powerful force for good, and we are committed to making a positive impact on the world.

But the left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) with 11% found itself in the position of kingmaker and refused to give its votes to the ANC.Analysis: Milton Nkosi, BBC Africa, JohannesburgThe election of the Democratic Alliance's Herman Mashaba as mayor of Johannesburg represents a tectonic shift in South African politics.This is the first time since the end of apartheid that the ANC lost control of the city of gold, as Johannesburg is known locally.The Johannesburg wing of the ANC is known within the party to be professional and not corrupt.However, voters still punished it for the litany of corruption scandals the ANC has been involved in at a national level.And there were some local problems, including potholed roads, a shambolic electricity billing system and refuse strikes that left the city filthy.What has happened in Johannesburg is a microcosm of what could happen nationally come the general election in 2019.Mr Mashaba, a 56-year-old businessman, has promised to reform the city administration. \"As of this evening, corruption is declared public enemy number one in this city,\" he told cheering supporters. \"Public monies that have been misspent, misused, over the last five, 10 years or so ... we're going to take this money, we're going to look after it, so that we can provide basic services to our people. \"Mr Mashaba also pledged to tackle unemployment. \"Over 800,000 of our residents, one-in-three, are today unemployed.

Maschaba won the election with a small margin of 52% of the vote and vowed to address the city’s pressing problems, including corruption, poverty and inequality. His promises of robbing corruption and improving service delivery resonated with voters who over the years have become disillusioned with the governance of the ANC. The ANC has dominated South Africa politics since the country's transition to democracy and faced criticism over its handling of the economy, high unemployment rates and allegations of corruption. The party's loss in Johannesburg is seen as a significant blow to its national leadership that has been struggling to maintain its grip on power. The DA, traditionally considered a party of the white minority, has made significant inroads in recent years, attracting the support of black South Africans who are disillusioned with the governance of the ANC. Mashaba's election is seen as a major breakthrough for the party that has sought to expand its influence beyond traditional strongholds. The new mayor has pledged to work with all parties to address the city's challenges, including improving access to housing and basic services and promoting economic growth. His election is seen as a fresh start for Johannesburg, which has been plagued by corruption and mismanagement in recent years. As Mashaba takes office, he faces significant challenges, including a budget deficit and a backlog of service delivery issues. However, his election has sparked hope among Johannesburg residents who are eager for change and a new direction for their city. Mashaba's victory is also seen as a significant shift in the political landscape of South Africa as it marks the first time that the DA has gained control of a major metropolitan municipality in the country. The party leader, Mmusi Maimane, has hailed Mashaba's election as a \"historic moment\" for the DA and a \"new dawn\" for Johannesburg. \"This election is a clear rejection of the corrupt and incompetent government of the ANC,\" Maimane said in a statement. The people of Johannesburg have spoken loudly and clearly and they have chosen a new path forward. We are committed to working tirelessly to deliver on our promises and to restore the city to its former glory. \"Mashaba's election has also sparked interest from international investors who see the change in leadership as an opportunity to invest in Johannesburg's economy.",

The rejection of VW's proposal is a significant setback for the automaker who has been struggling since the scandal broke in September to regain public trust and comply with emission regulations. The company had proposed a fix which would involve software updates and hardware modifications to the affected vehicles, but CARB deemed the plan insufficient. CARB's decision comes after a separate investigation by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which found that VW's proposed fix did not meet federal emissions standards. The EPA has given VW until March 24 to come up with a revised plan. The scandal has already cost VW billions of dollars in recalls, fines and sales lost. The company has committed $7.3 billion to cover the costs of the scandal, but analysts estimate the total bill could be much higher.VW has admitted installing \"defeat devices\" in millions of vehicles worldwide, including nearly 500,000 in the USA, to cheat on emissions tests. The vehicles allowed the emissions of up to 40 times the legal limit of nitrogen oxides, a pollutant that contributes to smog and respiratory problems, but critics say the response of VW was slow and inadequate. \"VW's proposal was a half-hearted attempt to fix the problem,\" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign. They have to take responsibility for their actions and come up with a real solution that protects the public health and the environment. \"The rejection of the proposal of VW is likely to add to the company's woes, which include multiple lawsuits, congressional investigations and a damaged reputation. As the scandal continues to unfold, one thing is clear: VW has a long way to go to regain the trust of the regulators, customers and the public.",

The return of Charlie Austin and Matt Targett to full training is a welcome sight for Southampton fans, but it's clear that they are not quite ready to make their comeback yet. The Saints are careful not to rush them back into action, especially now that the season is now drawing to a close. As for Hull, they will be without Omar Elabdellaoui for the foreseeable future, with the defender s back problem showing no signs of improvement. It is a blow for the Tigers, who have relied on the Norwegian's defensive prowess throughout the campaign.But with Niasse leading the line, Hull will be confident of causing problems for their opponents. The Senegalese striker has been in fine form this season, and his availability is a timely boost for Marco Silva's side.As Mark Scott pointed out, this is a huge opportunity for Hull to apply pressure on Swansea who are making a tough trip to Everton on Sunday. A win for the Tigers would see them move within three points of their relegation rivals and with the Swans struggling to find form, Hull will be sensing a chance to make a real statement at the KCOM Stadium. The stakes are more high than ever Can Hull take advantage of Swansea's struggles and make a late push for survival? Only time will tell. The atmosphere at the KCOM Stadium is expected to be electric and the Hull faithful know about the importance of this fixture. The Tigers have been in decent form at home, with three wins in their last five games, and they'll be looking to make the most of their advantage.Southampton, on the other hand, have been inconsistent on the road, with just two wins in their last eight away games.",

In the final three months of 2015, it was $44.Today it is $34. That is the background to today's results from BP.Bob Dudley, BP's chief executive, told me two weeks ago that he expected the oil price to rise as high as$50-60 a barrel by the end of the year, as the oil majors desperately cut production and demand grows from China and the US.Global supply and demand, at least from his company's point of view, will be in better balance, he argued.It is clear from the strain the low oil price is putting on BP that another year of falling prices will mean yet more job losses in both the upstream (oil exploration and production, including the North Sea) and downstream (refining and sale of fuel) businesses.Both of the main engines of the business are now spluttering and puffing out uncomfortable-looking black smoke.That will put fresh pressure on BP's dividend, vital to our savings and pension funds. For the moment, BP says it is wholly committed to maintaining the payments.More from KamalMichael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said BP faced hard choices: \"With average oil prices still trading at multi-year lows so far this year, the question now needs to be asked, how long can BP sustain the dividend at current levels without an imminent pick-up in oil prices? \"How many more jobs will BP need to cut from its already reduced 80,000 workforce in the coming months in order to sustain its payout against a backdrop of a possible ratings downgrade, and lower energy prices for longer? \"BP's results are the latest in a round of weak fourth-quarter results in the sector.Last week, Chevron announced its first quarterly loss in more than 13 years.Shell, which reports its fourth-quarter and full-year results on Thursday, has warned in a trading statement that its underlying profits could be halved.BP's shares ended trading 8.7% lower at 335.1p.",

        "text": "The job cuts announced on Tuesday are in addition to the 4,000 jobs that BP announced last year in its downstream division as part of a $2.5 billion restructuring program. The company has struggled to cope with the sharp decline in oil prices, which has caused pressure on its profits and forced it to reduce costs.The results of BP were also affected by a $433 million charge related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. BP has set aside a total of $55.5 billion to cover the costs of the disaster which was one of the worst environmental disasters in history. Despite the challenges, it said it would maintain its dividend payout to shareholders of $0.10 per share for the fourth quarter. The company has come under pressure from investors to reduce its dividend due to the falling oil prices but Mr. Dudley said that the payout was \"sustainable\" and that the company was committed to maintaining it. BP's shares fell sharply on the news, slamming 5.5% to 326p in early trading on the London Stock Exchange. The company’s stock has lost more than 40% of its value over the past year, reflecting the decline in oil prices and the challenges facing the energy industry. The results are the latest in a series of disappointing earnings reports from major oil companies struggling to cope with the sharp decline in oil prices. Royal Dutch Shell, another major oil company, reported a 44% fall in profits last week, while the profits of ExxonMobil fell 58% in the fourth quarter. The decline in oil prices has been driven by a combination of factors, including a surge in production from shale - oil fields in the United States and a decline in demand from major economies such as China. The Brent crude price, the global benchmark, has fallen by more than 70% since its peak in 2014, putting pressure on oil companies to reduce costs and adapt to the new reality. The announcement of BP comes as the oil industry is currently facing the worst decline in decades. The company's decision to cut jobs and reduce costs is seen as a necessary step to remain afloat on a market where oil prices are expected to remain low for the foreseeable future. \"We are taking a proactive approach to address the challenges facing our industry,\" said Mr. Dudley. We are focused on reducing costs, improving efficiency and investing in the projects that will stimulate long-term growth. BP reported a profit for the fourth quarter of $1.1 billion despite the challenges, down from $2.2 billion for the same period last year.",

The Light Blues finished third in the Scottish Premiership last season and were expected to make it past the tiny Luxembourg outfit ranked 440th by UEFA. Progres Niederkorn had other plans as they capitalized on Rangers' lackluster performance to secure a historic upset. The damage was done in the first match, where Rangers were held to 1-1 draw at Stade Josy Barthel in Luxembourg. Despite dominating possession, the Scottish side struggled to create clear-cut chances and were punished for their profligacy when Emmanuel Françoise scored a smashing equaliser for Progres Niederkorn. The return leg was expected to be a formality, but Rangers were once again mediocre and were unable to break down a resolute defense of Progres Niederkorn. The visitors sealed their place in the next round with a 2-0 win, courtesy of goals from Olivier Thill and Sebastien Thill. Rangers Manager Pedro Caixinha was left to lament his side's lack of intensity and creativity as they failed to overcome their clever opponents. \"We didn't deserve to win,\" Caixinha admitted in his post-match press conference. \"We didn't create enough opportunities, and when we did we didn't take them.

They will now face AEL Limassol of Cyprus in the next round, when they look to continue their fairy-tale run in the competition. The remarkable victory of the Luxembourg outfit has sent shockwaves through the football world with many pundits and fans struggling to understand how the mighty Rangers were crushed by a team of part-time players.

According to Rohrer's lawsuit, she was vaccinated with Bayer's Gardasil 9 vaccine designed to protect against human papillomavirus (HPV). Shortly after receiving the vaccine, Rohrer began to develop severe symptoms, including muscle weakness, numbness, and vision problems. Her condition rapidly deteriorated and was eventually diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disorder known as Guillain-Barré syndrome.Rohrer's lawyers argue that the vaccine caused her illness, citing studies that suggest a possible connection between Gardasil 9 and Guillain-Barré syndrome. They seek €200,000 in damages to compensate Rohrer for medical expenses, lost income and pain and suffering. Benayer denied any liability, declaring that the vaccine has undergone rigorous testing and was approved by regulatory authorities around the world. The company claims that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks, and that Rohrer is likely a coincidence.The case sparked widespread debate in Germany about the safety of vaccines and the responsibility of pharmaceutical companies to ensure the well-being of patients. It is expected to be a closely watched and highly publicized trial with implications for the vaccine industry as a whole. Ronald's lawyer Ursula Nelles said that \"this case is not just about our client's individual experience, but about holding pharmaceutical companies responsible for the safety of their products. We believe that Bayer has a responsibility to provide safe and effective vaccines, and we will fight to ensure that they are held to this standard. The trial is to begin in early 2023 and is expected to last several weeks. The result could have significant implications for vaccine manufacturers and public health policy in Germany and beyond.",

They were almost comical songs that he would work out with his horn players. There was lot of wild horn parts and experimentation with samples. \"However, the ownership of the music is unclear. Much of the material was recorded when Prince was under contract to Warner Bros, and he subsequently signed one-off deals with every other major label, several independents and Jay-Z's Tidal streaming service.The musician died from an overdose of the painkiller fentanyl in April without leaving a will.Courts have still to decide how to divide up his estate, with several potential heirs coming forward in the months after his death.A tribute concert to the star will take place in St Paul, Minnesota, on Thursday, featuring performances from Stevie Wonder, Christina Aguilera, Chaka Khan, Tori Kelly and Prince's first wife Mayte Garcia, among others.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

The album, which was originally published in 1984, has been certified 13x platinum and is widely considered one of the greatest albums of all time.In addition to the Purple Rain reissue, the estate is also planning to release a new greatest hits compilation which will feature some of Prince's favorite tracks alongside some of the unreleased material from the vault.

The second option is a land-based tax, which would see landowners pay a tax on the value of their land, rather than the property that sits on it. This approach is seen as a way to encourage more efficient use of land and to earn revenue from underutilized or vacant plots. The third option is an income tax, which would see individuals pay a percentage of their income towards local government funding. This approach is seen as a way to make the system more progressive, with those who earn more contributing a greater share of the tax burden.

The statistics revealed by Ruth Davidson showed that in 2019 28% of the students from the most rich backgrounds completed three grades of A, compared to just 4% of those from the most deprived areas. The Tory leader claimed that the figures showed a \"shocking\" lack of progress in closing the achievement gap and accused the SNP government of failing to take decisive action to address the issue. \"Despite the warm words of the First Minister, the reality is that the gap between achievement and achievement remains stubbornly wide,\" Ms Davidson said. \"It's simply not good enough that the chances of success of a child are still determined by their postcode and the income of their parents. We need to see a sense of urgency and a willingness to take bold action to tackle this problem one and for all. \"The exchange came as the Scottish Government faced increasing pressure to improve educational outcomes, especially for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The attainment fund, which was launched in 2016, aims to provide targeted support to schools in the most deprived areas but critics argue that more needs to be done to address the root causes of the attainment gap. In response to Ms Davidson's criticism, Ms Sturgeon pointed to the progress made in increasing the number of pupils from deprived areas achieving at least one Higher and highlighted the Government's commitment to continue investing in the attainment fund. The debate is likely to continue in the coming weeks, with opposition parties and education campaigners calling for more radical actions to tackle the attainment gap and improve educational outcomes for all the Scottish pupils. The Scottish government has faced criticism for its handling of the attainment gap, with some arguing that the current approach is too focused on short-term fixes rather than the underlying causes of the problem. Iain Gray, the Labour Education spokesperson, said that the government's reliance on the attainment fund was a \"sticking plaster\" solution that failed to address the root causes of the attainment gap. \"The attainment fund is a welcome initiative, but it is not a substitute for a comprehensive strategy to tackle poverty and inequality,\" Mr Gray said.",

The new gorilla, who has not been named yet, is currently being cared for by the zoo staff and is receiving around-the-clock attention.

The species is threatened by habitat loss, poaching and disease, and every birth is a vital step towards their survival. Bristol Zoo Gardens is part of the European breeding program for western lowland gorillas and has a long history of successfully breeding the species. The zoo is now hoping to use the experience gained from this C-section to help other zoos and conservation organizations around the world.

In an interview with today by BBC Radio 4, Wolfson said \"migrants make a vital contribution to our economy by filling gaps in the labor market and bringing new skills and ideas to the table.\" \"Arbitrarily cap immigration at the tens of thousands would be a recipe for disaster - and would likely lead to a brain drain of talented individuals which are essential to our economic growth. Wolfson's comments come as the government faces mounting pressure to deliver on its promise to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands — a promise that has been repeatedly delayed and is now seen as becoming increasingly unrealistic. The Next CEO's warning is likely to resonate with many in the business community who have long argued that immigration is crucial to filling labor gaps and driving economic growth. According to a recent survey by the CBI, 70% of businesses believe that immigration is essential to their operations and that a reduction in immigration would have a negative impact on their ability to recruit skilled workers. Wolfson's comments are likely to spark a wider debate on the role of immigration in the UK economy and the need for a more nuanced approach to immigration policy that takes into account the needs of businesses and the economy as a whole. We are committed to reducing net migration to the tens of thousands while also ensuring that we attract the brightest and best talent from around the world. The critics argue, however, that the government approach to immigration is too focused on reducing the number and does not take into account the complex needs of businesses and economy. As the debate continues, one thing is clear: the issue of immigration will remain a major point of contention in the months and years ahead. The stance of the government on immigration has been a contentious issue for years, with many arguing that the focus on reducing numbers is misguided and fails to address the real needs of the economy. Wolfson's comments have added fuel to the fire and it is likely that the debate will only intensify in the coming weeks and months. One of the key concerns is the potential impact on certain industries such as healthcare and technology which rely heavily on immigrant workers to fill the gaps in labor. According to a recent report by the National Health Service (NHS), nearly 12% of NHS personnel are non-British, with many coming from countries such as India, the Philippines and Nigeria.",

Many Opec nations are able to tolerate a lower oil price despite losing money.For other nations such as Russia the lower oil price is doing substantial harm to economic growthLast month, official figures showed the impact of international sanctions over Russia's continued involvement in east Ukraine and the lower oil prices had led to a 4.9% contraction in the Russian economy in the 12 months to May.The IEA said Opec crude oil production rose 340,000 barrels per day (BPD) in June to 31.7 million barrels a day, a three-year high, led by record output from Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.It said Saudi Arabian crude oil supply rose 50,000 barrels per day to a record high of 10.35 million BPD in June, while Iraq crude oil output surged 270,000 BPD in June to its highest-ever rate of 4.12 million BPD.However, increases in production have come just as demand for oil in economies across the world from Europe to China - the world's second-largest consumer of oil - has slowed.The IEA trimmed its forecast for global oil demand growth this year slightly to 1.39 million BPD and said it expected global demand growth to slow to 1.2 million BPD in 2016.The agency added non-Opec supply growth was expected to grind to a halt in 2016 as lower oil prices and spending cuts take their toll.

The impact of lower oil prices is already being felt in the industry with many companies announcing significant cuts in their capital expenditure budgets. According to a recent report the top seven oil majors have cut their investment plans by a combined $100 billion over the next five years. The North Sea has been a significant contributor to the UK economy for decades, which is particularly vulnerable to the downturn. The high production costs of the region, combined with the fall in oil prices, have made it increasingly difficult for operators to remain profitable. Many fields now operate at a loss, and some have even been forced to close temporarily. The UK government has also been severely impacted by taxing North Sea oil and gas, with revenues falling by 80% over the past three years. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has forecast that oil and gas revenues in the North Sea will continue to decline, falling below 0.1% of the GDP in the coming decades. The problems of the industry are not limited to the North Sea. Oil-producing countries around the world are feeling the pinch and many face significant deficits as a result of the decline in oil prices. The situation also sparked concerns about the potential for social unrest and political instability in some of these countries. Some analysts believe that the current downturn could eventually lead to a more sustainable and efficient oil industry. The low oil price environment is forcing the companies to rethink their business models and focus on reducing costs and improving efficiency, said an industry expert. The long-run could lead to a more resilient and competitive industry. For now the outlook remains however uncertain, and the industry is prepared for a prolonged period of low oil prices.

The report identified several key areas where Glasgow is likely to be affected, including the potential loss of EU funding for projects and initiatives that could have a significant impact on city's economy and infrastructure development. * The uncertainty surrounding the rights of EU citizens living and working in Glasgow, which could lead to a brain drain and skill shortage * The potential disruption to trade and investment which could affect Glasgow's businesses and industries.The Council calls on both governments to provide guarantees that EU-funded projects are protected and continue and that the rights of EU citizens will be safeguarded. \"We cannot afford to wait and see what happens,\" said Councillor McAveety. We need now to ensure that Glasgow is protected and supported during this period of uncertainty. We are calling on both governments to work together to provide the necessary support and reassurance to our city-region. \"The report also highlights the need for greater investment in skills and education to help Glasgow's workforce adapt to the changing economic landscape. \"Glasgow has a proud history of innovation and resilience, and we are determined to ensure that our city region emerges from this period of uncertainty stronger and more prosperous than ever,\" said Councillor McAveety. The council will work closely with local businesses, universities and community groups to develop a comprehensive plan to mitigate the impacts of Brexit and to ensure that Glasgow remains a vibrant and attractive place to live, work and invest. The findings of the report have sparked concerns among local business leaders who are urging the governments to swiftly act to address the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Glasgow is a city that has always been open to the world and we need to make sure we remain an attractive destination for investment and talent, said Stuart Patrick, chief executive of the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce. \"The lack of clarity about EU funding and the rights of EU citizens is causing serious anxiety amongst our members and we need the governments to offer assurance that they will support our city region through this time of transition. The report also highlights the need for more investment in digital infrastructure to support the growing technology sector in Glasgow.",

He was a respected member of the community and was actively involved in local charities.Tragically, Mr. Chilowa's life was turned upside down when a devastating house fire claimed the lives of two people, including his partner, and left him with severe burns. The incident occurred on February 10 at a house in Withington, Manchester and left the community in shock. In the aftermath of the tragedy a petition was launched to urge the Home Office to allow Mr. Chilowa to remain in the UK citing concerns over his safety if he were deported back to Zimbabwe. The petition has garnered more than 3,000 signatures with many calling for compassion and humanity in the face of such a devastating tragedy. The Home Office has however stated that Mr. Chilowa does not need the UK protection and can return safely to Zimbabwe. This decision has sparked outrage among those who know and fight M. Chilowa to keep him in the country. \"Robert was through an unimaginable tragedy, and to deport him back to Zimbabwe would be another injustice, said a family friend who wanted to remain anonymous. He has built here a life and to take that away would be cruel. We ask the Home Office to reconsider their decision and show some compassion. The case has sparked a wider debate about the immigration policies of the UK and the treatment of asylum seekers. Many are calling for a more humane approach to be taken, especially in cases where individuals have had traumatizing experiences.It remains to be seen whether the Home Office will reconsider their decision and allow Mr. Chilowa to remain in the UK.",

The defensive midfielder has made more than 200 appearances for the Posh since joining in 2012 and has been a key component of the team's midfield. On the other hand, Maddison has been a creative force in the attack, scoring 10 goals and providing 12 assists in all competitions this season. The club's decision to transfer the duo is seen as a precautionary measure to avoid losing them on free transfers at the end of the season when their contracts are due to expire. In addition to Bostwick and Maddison, five other players have also been listed to transfer, including the defenders Andrew Hughes and Michael Smith, the midfielders Chris Forrester and Brad Inman and the striker Luke James.The news is likely to spark a flurry of interest from other clubs, with several Championship and League One teams already being monitored. The manager of Peterborough United, Grant McCann, has expressed his disappointment with the situation, but acknowledged that it was a necessary step to ensure the club’s long-term financial stability. \"We're disappointed that we have to take this step, but we have to be realistic about the situation,\" McCann said in a statement. \"We've had some great times with these players, but we can't afford to lose them for nothing.\" We'll do all we can to get the best deal possible for the club. The transfer to Bostwick and Maddison is a major blow to Peterborough United’s promotion hopes, but the club will be hoping to use the funds from their sales to strengthen the squad and to push for a playoff spot.",

Why would you not do that? \"The businessman visited King Solomon Academy in London - a school which serves a poor area, but has achieved the best GCSE results of any non-selective school in England.The headteacher, Max Haimendorf, told BBC Scotland much of that success was down to being independent of local authority control.He said: \"The governors, the people who work sort of behind the school, very ambitious people, both successful in business, and they wanted to kind of make something happen for this community and in education. \"\"That led to a level of ambition and that doesn't necessarily mean just replicating what has happened before.

We must be more willing to challenge the status quo and not fear the failure. « Sir Tom's comments come as the Scottish government prepares to publish its long-awaited Education Reform bill. The bill is expected to include measures to give headteachers more autonomy and introduce more flexibility in the curriculum. Teachers' unions have expressed concerns about the direction of the reforms, arguing that they could lead to a fragmentation of the education system and a lack of accountability. We need to focus on evidence-based policy making, rather than ideological experiments. In the coming weeks and months, the debate over education reform in Scotland is likely to continue, with Sir Tom's intervention adding fuel to the fire. As the Scottish Government prepares to push for its reforms, it remains to be seen if schools in the country will be able to overcome the obstacles and become the best in the world. The Scottish Government's education reform bill is expected to be published in the coming weeks and is likely to spark a heated debate among educators, policymakers and parents. The bill is expected to include measures to give headteachers more autonomy and allows them to make decisions about curriculum, staffing and budgeting. This action is seen as a way to promote innovation and improvement in schools, but critics argue that it could lead to a lack of accountability and widening the gap between rich and poor schools.

His call for a more open-minded and courageous approach to education reform has resonated with some but others argue that the focus should be on evidence-based policy making rather than ideological experiments.

But the signal this sends, bringing two of the world's biggest economic powers together, is unmistakeable.EU-Japan negotiations began in 2012 then stalled. It was Donald Trump's election, and the inward turn America is taking, that spurred the EU and Japan to overcome their differences. Both want to show domestic audiences they can deliver signature deals that promise new economic opportunities.They also want to send a clear message internationally that the EU and Japan, highly-developed democracies, remain committed to a liberal, free-trading, rules-based world, and they will seek to shape it even if the US won't.The outline plan was signed in Brussels after a meeting between the Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, and the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, on the eve of a meeting of the G20 group of leading economies in Hamburg.It comes hard on the heels of the collapse of a long-awaited trade agreement between Japan, the US and other Pacific ring countries, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was scrapped in January by US President Donald Trump.The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the agreement showed the EU's commitment to world trade: \"We did it. We concluded EU-Japan political and trade talks. EU is more and more engaged globally. \"Mr Tusk also said the deal countered the argument put forward by some of those in favour of Brexit that the EU was unable to promote free trade: \"Although some are saying that the time of isolationism and disintegration is coming again, we are demonstrating that this is not the case. \"He added that the deal was not just about common trade interests, but reflected \"the shared values that underpin our societies, by which I mean liberal democracy, human rights and the rule of law\".Japan is the world's third-largest economy, with a population of about 127 million.As it stands, the country is Europe's seventh biggest export market.One of the most important trade categories for the EU is dairy goods.Japan's appetite for milk and milk-based products has been growing steadily in recent years.The EU's dairy farmers are struggling with falling demand in its home nations and an ultra-competitive buying climate, which farmers say means they are paid less than the cost of production.Even once the agreement is fully signed, the deal is likely to have in place long transition clauses of up to 15 years to allow sectors in both countries time to adjust to the new outside competition.",

This will make European exports to Japan cheaper and more competitive, and vice versa.The agreement also includes provisions on intellectual property, labor standards and environmental protection that are expected to promote investment and innovation between the two regions. The complementary Strategic Partnership Agreement is a broader framework that covers cooperation in areas such as security, defence and climate change. It is seen as a significant step in strengthening the relations between Japan and the EU and promoting global governance. The deal is a major victory for the EU trade policy, which has been under pressure in recent years. It shows the ability of the EU to negotiate complex trade agreements and promote free trade, despite the challenges posed by rising protectionionism. The agreement is also a significant boost for Japan which has been seeking to diversify its trade relations and reduce its dependence on the US market. The agreement is expected to provide a major stimulus to the economy of Japan that has been suffering with low growth and an aging population. Although the agreement is a major achievement, it is not without its challenges. The EU and Japan will need to work together to implement the agreement and address any issues that arise. There are also concerns about the impact of the agreement on certain industries, such as European farmers who may face increased competition from Japanese imports.Overall, the trade deal is a significant step forward in promoting free trade and cooperation between two of the largest economic regions in the world. It is a testament to the power of diplomacy and negotiation and a reminder that even in uncertain times, countries can work together to promote mutual benefit and prosperity. The trade deal between the EU and Japan is also seen as a model for future trade agreements demonstrating that it is possible to negotiate complex trade deals that benefit both parties. The focus on free trade, investment and innovation, while also addressing issues such as intellectual property, labor standards, and environmental protection, sets a high standard for future trade agreements. The deal is expected to have a significant impact on the global economy, with the EU and Japan accounting for about 30% of global GDP. The increased trade and investment flows between the two regions are expected to create new jobs, encourage economic growth and increase competitiveness.In addition, the agreement is seen as a counterbalance to rising protectionist and trade tensions between the USA and China.",

Furthermore, the report revealed that nearly one in three apps (29%) were requesting an excessive amount of personal information, raising concerns about the potential misuse of sensitive data. This lack of transparency and excessive data collection can lead to a range of issues, including identity theft, targeted advertising and even discrimination. The Information Commissioner of the United Kingdom (ICO) has endorsed the findings and emphasized the need for app developers to prioritize user privacy and transparency. \"It is unacceptable that so many apps fail to provide clear and concise information about how they gather and use personal data,\" said an ICO spokesperson. App developers must assume responsibility for ensuring that their products respect the privacy of users and comply with data protection laws. The GPEN Report highlights the need for more accountability and regulation in the app industry. With millions of people around the world relying on mobile apps for everyday tasks, entertainment and communication, it is essential that these apps are designed with privacy and security in mind. The ICO has urged app developers to examine their data collection practices and ensure that they comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant data protection laws. The regulator has also promised to take enforcement actions against app developers who fail to meet their obligations.

And then we will agree. \"And so it was.And now the leaders of the EU institutions - the Commission, European Parliament and Council who clearly enjoyed being the focus of and lead-story trigger for the hungry-for-any-details British press during the negotiations - will have to endure returning to relative UK obscurity once again.As the UK media now turns its sights to Westminster and the referendum itself.",

        "text": "It was perhaps a symbolic gesture, but one that highlighted the UK's unique position within the European Union.The deal itself, praised by Cameron as a \"major breakthrough\" and a \"good deal for Britain\", has been met with a mix of reactions from EU leaders and commentators. While some have praised the agreement as a necessary compromise to keep the UK within the EU fold, others expressed concerns that it sets a dangerous precedent for other member states seeking similar special treatment. At the heart of the deal are four key areas of reform : sovereignty, economic governance, competitiveness, and immigration. The UK has secured concessions on all four fronts, including a commitment to exempt Britain from the EU’s goal of \"ever closer union\" and a mechanism to allow the UK to delay or veto EU legislation deemed dangerous to its interests. Also Cameron has won an agreement on measures to reduce the migration to the UK, including a seven-year ban on benefits for EU migrants and a commitment to crack down on the abuse of the welfare system. Some EU leaders have however expressed reservations about the impact of these measures on the free movement of people, a fundamental principle of the EU. Despite the fanfare surrounding the deal, it remains to be seen whether it will suffice to sway the British public opinion in favor of remaining within the EU. The referendum on EU membership in the UK, scheduled for June 23 is likely to be a closely fought and highly divisive campaign, with both the \"Leave\" and \"Remain\" camps already gearing up for battle. For now though, Cameron can bask in the glow of a hard-earned diplomatic victory that has established his reputation as a skilled and determined negotiator. Whether it will prove enough to secure Britain's place within the EU remains to be seen. As the dust settles on the EU deal, the attention is already turning to the next phase of the fight: gaining over the British public. Cameron and his allies in the \"Remain\" camp face a daunting task of convincing a skeptical electorate that the guaranteed reforms are sufficient to justify continuing membership of the EU.Polls suggest that the British public remains deeply divided on the issue, with many voters still undecided or leaning towards leaving the EU. The Leave campaign, led by figures such as Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, was quick to exploit perceived weakness in the deal, arguing that it does not reach far enough in addressing concerns over sovereignty and immigration. One of the major challenges facing the Remain camp is the perception that the EU deal is a series of vague promises and compromises, rather than a fundamental transformation of the UK's relationship with the EU.",

        "text": "If intensive care units, for example, are full then there are no available beds there for patients who need them to recover from serious scheduled operations.If that is the case -  some elective surgery will inevitably get postponed.Late last year, the Welsh Government pledged an extra Â£45m to health boards to try make sure scheduled, elective surgery and treatments are  more protected this winter.NHS Wales chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall said it was still too early to tell in terms of numbers but hospitals needed to ensure elective surgery was managed in a \"sensible manner\" as there was a duty to patients.Another interesting thing to note - sometimes the figures show that unscheduled care units actually see a greater number of patients during the summer months - due to trips, slips, falls, bumps and so on.But in winter the NHS often has to deal with more severely-ill patients, for example elderly patients who have breathing problems.These need much more care, spend more time in the system and need more support to get better.COMPARING WALES WITH ENGLANDHistorically A&E waits have been longer in Wales than in England. Some experts argue that is because there is a bigger mismatch in Wales between the number of beds available and the demand for them.The difference might also reflect demographic factors -  for example the Welsh population as a whole being older sicker and less well-off than other parts of the UK.It is not straightforward comparing Wales with the NHS in England, because the \"clock\" starts differently when patients arrive.For those in Wales, the waiting time starts being recorded as soon as the patient is registered inside the A&E department - or when the ambulance crew notifies the desk they have arrived outside.In England, the arrival time starts when the patient is handed over or 15 minutes after the ambulance arrives at A&E, whichever is earlier.Leaked data for NHS England seen by BBC News shows the figure reached a low of 75.8% on 3 January but had recovered to 82.4% last week.HOW DO DIFFERENT HOSPITALS COMPARE?ARE THINGS GETTING MORE DIFFICULT?Looking back at A&E waiting times statistics in Wales over recent years - what is clear is that in each successive year things appear to be getting ever more difficult - despite the Welsh Government ploughing more money each year to help health boards deliver they're winter plans.What is not in doubt though is staff on the front line are trying hard to make sure patients get treated safely - even when the pressure is really on.The problem is the pressures year on year show little sign of easing.",

The latest figures from the NHS reveal that emergency departments are indeed struggling to cope with demand. The waiting times have soared, with many patients waiting for hours to be seen, and some even being treated in corridors or on trolleys in makeshift areas. Sarah Johnson, a consultant in emergency medicine, warned that the situation is \"unsustainable\" and that the staff \"are at the breaking point\". She added that the lack of beds and resources is not only affecting patient care but also taking a toll on the mental and physical health of NHS staff. The British Medical Association ( BMA ) has also sounded the alarm, stating that the NHS is facing a \"perfect storm\" of rising demand, staffing shortages and inadequate funding. The BMA is calling for urgent action to address the crisis, including increased investment in social care and a comprehensive workforce plan to address staffing gaps. In the meantime, patients are the brunt of the crisis. Many face long waits for treatment, and some are even forced to seek private treatment due to delays. The situation is especially dangerous for vulnerable patients, such as those with complex medical conditions, who are often most in need of timely and effective care. As the NHS struggles to cope with the pressure, health experts warn that the situation will only worsen unless drastic action is taken. With the winter approaching, the traditional peak season for demand of the NHS, the stakes are higher than ever. The government has pledged to increase funding for the NHS, but many argue that it is too little, too late.As the crisis deepens, one thing is clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture and urgent action is needed to prevent a complete collapse of the system. The question on everyone's lips is : what will it take to fix the NHS and who will take responsibility for ensuring that our national health service is fit for purpose? The NHS Crisis: A National EmergencyAs the NHS tumbles on the brink of collapse, the government is facing mounting pressure to take drastic action to address the crisis. The situation is dire with patients waiting for hours, even days, for treatment and staff stretched to the breaking point. The latest figures paint a grim picture. According to the NHS’ own data, more than 4 million people are waiting for surgery, with many more waiting for diagnostic tests and other treatments. The wait list has grown by over 10% in the last year, with some waiting for treatment for over a year. The situation is especially dire in emergency departments where patients are treated by the lack of beds in corridors and trolleys.",

Victoria Balch, who was only 20 years old at the time of the accident, suffered severe leg injuries, including a shattered ankle and a broken knee. She was left with chronic pain despite six rounds of surgery and was eventually forced to make the difficult decision of having her leg amputated.Speaking on the Victoria Derbyshire programme, Ms. Balch described the pain as a \"heavy burden that had taken over her life. \"I was in constant pain, 24/7,\" said she. \"I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I couldn't do anything without being in agony.\" Balch's decision to have her leg amputated was not taken lightly, but she said it was the only way to gain control of her life. She also said she wanted to live again to be able to do things without being in pain all the time. The crash on the Smiler - ride which is one of Alton Towers'most popular attractions was reported widely in the media and led to a significant drop in visitor numbers to the theme park. An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) found the crash was caused by human error with the staff failing to follow proper safety procedures.Merlin Attractions Operations Ltd, the company that operates Alton Towers was fined £5 million for breaking Health and Safety regulations. The company has since implemented new safety measures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. For Victoria Balch, the road to recovery is long and challenging, but she is determined to move forward and make the most of her new life. \"I'm still getting used to my new prosthetic leg but I'm determined to live my life to the fullest,\" she said. \"I won't let this accident define me\" The courage and resilience of Ms. Balch in the face of adversity have inspired many, and her story has led to a national conversation about theme park safety and the importance of prioritizing visitor well-being.In the aftermath of the accident, Alton Towers implemented a variety of new safety measures, including enhanced staff training and improved safety protocols. The theme park has also worked to rebuild trust with its customers, launching a series of initiatives aimed at promoting safety and transparency. However, Ms. Balch's experience serves as a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of safety failures.",

Mitie, the parent company of MiHomecare, has faced criticism over its treatment of workers in the past. In 2015, the company was accused of exploiting its security guards by requiring them to pay below the minimum wage. The latest allegations have caused outrage among care workers and campaigners, who say that the company's practices are unacceptable. \"This is a shocking example of the exploitation of care workers, who are already under-valued and underpaid,\" said Dr. Jane Thompson, a care worker and activist. \"The government needs to take action to protect these workers and ensure that they are paid a fair wage for their vital work. \"The care regulator of the UK, the Care Quality Commission, has been approached for comment.",

According to a statement released by the company, the expected drop in profits is due to a combination of factors including increased competition in the market, higher production costs and a decline in sales in certain regions.The CEO of the company, Jane Smith, said in a statement: This unfortunately means in the short term we will need to reduce our dividends to shareholders. Nevertheless, we are confident that these measures will position us for long-term success and will benefit our shareholders in the years to come. The company has announced plans to implement a wide variety of cost-cutting measures, including reducing its workforce, streamlining operations and renegotiating contracts with suppliers. It is also exploring new revenue streams and investing in research and development to drive innovation and growth. The company remains committed to its long-term strategy and is confident that it can return to profitability in the near future. But the news is likely to be a setback for investors, who had hoped for a more positive outlook from the company. Analysts are already weighing in on the news with some predicting that the company's shares could continue to fall in coming days. \"This is a significant blow to the company's reputation and will likely lead to a period of uncertainty for investors,\" said an analyst. The company could recover in the long term if it can implement its cost cutting measures successfully and drive growth. The news sent shockwaves throughout the market, with the shares of the company soaring by over 10% in early trading. Investors are scrambling to reassess their portfolios and to adjust their expectations of future performance of the company. \"This is a major setback for the company, and it's clear that they are facing some major headwinds\", said Tom Johnson, a portfolio manager for a leading investment firm. \"We will have to take a close look at our holdings and consider whether we need to make some changes. Despite the grim outlook, some analysts remain hopeful that the company can turn things around.

        "text": "The People's Bank of China also cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 0.5 percentage points, effective from November 21, to free up more liquidity in the financial system. The RRR cut is expected to release around 600 billion yuan (€91 billion) into the economy, which could help boost lending and consumption. The move is also seen as a sign that the government is willing to take steps to support the economy despite concerns about rising debt levels and asset bubbles. The rate cut and reduction in RRR are positive for the economy as they help to reduce borrowing costs and increase liquidity, said Wang Qing, an economist at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The impact may be limited, however, as the economy faces significant headwinds, including a slowing property market and declining exports. The Chinese government has been under pressure to stimulate the economy, which has been slowing down in recent years. The 7% growth target for this year is seen as a key benchmark, and the government is likely to take further measures to support the economy if growth continues to slow.In addition to monetary policy easing the government has also been implementing fiscal policies to support the economy, including a higher infrastructure spending and a reduced tax rate. However, the effectiveness of these measures has been questioned by some analysts who argue that the structural problems in the economy need to be addressed in order to achieve sustainable growth. Many analysts believe that the Chinese economy will continue to grow at a slower pace than previously. \"We expect the economy to grow at about 6.5% next year, driven by domestic consumption and investment,\" said Wang. However, the government needs to continue to implement structural reforms to address the underlying problems of the economy and achieve sustainable growth.\" The efforts of the Chinese government to boost the economy come as the country's growth has been slowing in recent years. The economy grew at a rate of 6.6% in 2018 – down from 6.9% in 2017 – and is expected to slow down further in 2019 – a number of factors including a decline in the exports market, and a decline in domestic consumption. The ongoing trade tensions with the US have also had a significant impact on the economy with exports to the US falling by 10.7% in the first nine months of 2019 Despite the challenges, many analysts believe that the Chinese economy will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace.",

Through a combination of archival material, oral tests and immersive visuals, the artist invites viewers to confront the darker aspects of Australian history that have been systematically omitted or distorted over time. One of the primary focuses of \"Erased\" is the devastating impact of colonialism on Tasmanian indigenous population. Casey's work highlights the brutal treatment of the Palawa people, who were subjected to forced relocation, violence and cultural suppression. By centralizing the voices and experiences of the Palawa, the artist aims to challenge the dominant narratives that have long marginalized their stories.The installation also explores the role of Tasmania as a penal colony, where British convicts were sent to serve their sentences in harsh conditions. Casey's research reveals the often overlooked stories of these convicts, who were forced to endure grueling labor, corporal punishment and social isolation. By humanizing these individuals, the artist encourages viewers to reconsider their understanding of Australian history. Through \"Erased,\" Casey poses critical questions about the consequences of historical forgetting and the importance of acknowledging the past in order to build a more just and equitable society. By bringing these hidden stories to the forefront, the artist hopes to inspire a national conversation about the need for truth-telling, reconciliation and healing. \"Erased\" will be shown from 15 March to 15 June 2023 at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. The project has received widespread support from local communities, historians and cultural institutions and is expected to attract visitors from across Australia and beyond.",

You get, essentially, one of Zion's most massive cliffs collapsing, running across the canyon in 20 seconds with peak velocities of 90 metres per second (200mph),\" said Dr Moore.It is still not clear from the investigations what caused the rock avalanche. There is insufficient data on palaeo-earthquakes in the area to make a statement about a seismic trigger. It remains a possibility, but so too does a simple internal failure of the rock.And while there is evidence for other rock avalanches in the canyon, Dr Moore says a repeat event is not something the National Parks Service nor tourists should be unduly worried about.Just marvel at the spectacle, he urges. \"People when they go there, they look up to the huge Navajo sandstone cliffs, and I think it's a little more subtle to look down at our feet and wonder why this canyon is so accessible, why the valley floor is so flat? \"Studying landslides for my job, the story I tell is often connected to a lot of gloom and doom. But this is a case where a spectacular landslide did something in a spectacular setting, and it's an opportunity to reach out to people and tell them something new that they might not otherwise have known about landslides. \"I hope it is an enriching tale on the history of Zion. \"Now read about Jeff Moore's work on the rock arches of the southwestern US.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

The team's findings also shed light on the dynamics of the landslide itself. In analyzing the size and distribution of the debris, the researchers were able to reconstruct the event in remarkable detail. \"We found that the landslide was incredibly massive, with some boulders weighing hundreds of tons, \" explained Dr. Moore. It is likely that the slide was triggered by a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, earthquakes and the natural instability of the rock face. The creation of the lake which followed the landslide had a profound impact on the surrounding environment. As the lake filled with sediment, it created a flat, fertile valley floor that supported a diverse range of plant and animal life. Today, visitors to Zion National Park can still see evidence of this ancient lake, including the distinctive flat floor of the canyon and the unique rock formations that line its walls. Despite the centuries-old landslide that affected the park, the legacy continues to shape its landscape. The river Virgin, which was once blocked by the landslide, has carved a new path through the rock, creating a deep and winding canyon. And as the river continues to erode the landscape, it slowly reveals new secrets about the geological past of the region. The research of Moore and his team is a testament to the power of scientific inquiry to uncover the hidden stories of our planet's history. By combining cutting-edge techniques with old-fashioned detective work they have been able to reconstruct a pivotal moment in the formation of one of America's most beloved national parks. Dr. Moore said, “This study is a reminder that even in the most familiar landscapes there is always more to discover and that the natural world is full of surprises waiting to be discovered.\"",

The cuts that were agreed as part of a deal to raise the debt ceiling in 2011 are to hit a wide range of government programs, including defense, education and healthcare. In addition to the defense sector, other sectors are also prepared for the impact of the cuts. Education Secretary Arne Duncan warned that the sequester could lead to teacher layoffs and reduced funding for schools, while Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said that the cuts could impact healthcare services for vulnerable populations. The White House has been pushing for a package of spending cuts and tax increases to replace the sequester, but lawmakers have so far been unable to reach an agreement. The Republicans have insisted on reducing the deficit by cutting the budget only while Democrats have pushed for a more balanced approach that includes revenue increases.As the clock ticks down the deadline is growing the sense of urgency. Then he said, \"We can't sit back and just let these cuts happen\", said Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York. \"We need to come together and find a solution that works for everyone.

In addition to the ambulance services, other public sector unions including the Royal College of Midwives, the British Association of Occupational Therapists and the Society of Radiographers are planning strikes and other forms of industrial action over the coming weeks. The strike is expected to bring disruption to services across England with patients and the public being advised to call 999 in life-threatening emergency situations. The \"Our personnel are trained to provide medical support and will be working alongside the NHS staff to ensure that patients receive the care they need,\" said a spokesperson. The strike is the latest in a series of industrial actions by public sector workers who are increasingly frustrated with the government's austerity measures and what they see as a lack of investment in public services. The strike has sparked widespread concern among the patients and the general public, with many threatening to take to social media to express their support for the ambulance workers and criticise the government handling of the situation. This is a crisis of government's own making,\" tweeted Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. They have cut funding, frozen pay and ignored the concerns of the NHS staff. It's time for a change. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has come under fire for his response to the strike, with many accusing him of being out of touch with the reality of the situation. The offer of a 1% pay rise by the Health Secretary is an insult to the hardworking men and women who are the backbone of the NHS, said Jonathan Ashworth, Shadow Health Secretary at Labour.",

        "text": "The statement of the Chief Minister comes in response to growing criticism from opposition parties and civil society groups, who have been demanding greater transparency and access to government information. The controversy surrounds the recent decision of the government to increase the fees for FOI requests – which many argue will disproportionately affect marginalized communities and hamper their ability to hold those in power accountable. \"We understand the importance of transparency and accountability but we cannot ignore the fiscal realities,\" Harwood continued. The current system is unsustainable with the cost of processing FOI requests rising in recent years. We need a balance that works for everyone, not just a select few. Opposition leader Rachel Lee was quick to respond to Chief Ministers remarks and labeled them as \"out of touch\" and \"an attempt to stifle dissent.\" \"The government should be the first to serve the people, not to protect their own interests,\" Lee said in a statement. By raising FOI fees, they effectively price out ordinary citizens from accessing information that is rightfully theirs. The debate is expected to continue in the coming weeks with many calling for a more nuanced approach to balancing transparency with fiscal responsibility. When the government struggles with the complexities of open governance, one thing is clear: the right of the people to know is in question. As the controversy surrounding the Freedom of Information (FOI) fees continues to simmer, civil society groups and advocacy organizations are mobilizing to protest the decision of the government. A coalition of non-profit organizations, including the Transparency Initiative and the Citizens' Rights Association, has launched a petition to urge the government to reconsider the fee increase. The government's decision to increase the FOI fees is a clear attempt to undermine the public's right to access information, says Sarah Taylor, the Executive Director of the Transparency Initiative. We urge the government to prioritize transparency and accountability over fiscal concerns. The people have a right to know what their government is doing and it's the responsibility of government to ensure that information is available to all. The petition, which has already garnered thousands of signatures, calls on the government to reverse the fee hike and implement measures to increase transparency and accountability.",

Prosecutors told the court that Ahmed controlled every aspect of Ms. Iram's life, restricting her freedom and movements and forcing her to carry out domestic chores for up to 18 hours a day. He would often beat her, pulling her hair, slapping and punching her in the face. The abuse took a toll on Ms. Iram's mental health, and she tried to take her own life on several occasions. Despite her desperate situation, she was too afraid to seek help because of fear that her husband would carry out his threats to kill her and her family. It wasn't until August 2014 that Ms. Iram finally found the courage to raise the alarm and confided in a neighbor who helped her to contact the police. Ahmed was arrested and charged with a person in servitude and assault causing actual bodily harm. During the trial the court heard that Ahmed had treated Ms. Iram as a slave and forced her to work long hours without pay and denied her basic human rights. The jury was also shown evidence of the physical abuse, including photographs of Ms. Iram's injuries and testimony from medical professionals who treated her. Detective Inspector Melanie Pressley, who led the investigation, praised Ms. Iram's bravery in coming forward and said that Ahmed's conviction sent a strong message to perpetrators of domestic abuse. No one deserves to be treated like a slave or subjected to physical and emotional abuse, she said.

The Welsh government and the MoD are working hard to fill the gap. \"St Athan's history as an aircraft maintenance base dates back to 1938.Just before and during World War II many different types of aircraft were assembled, test flown and maintained there by a staff of 14,000, and the base inevitably became a target for German bombers.By the mid-1990s there were 3,500 engineers repairing fighter jets.But since then the St Athan site has since endured more than a decade of uncertainty and failed attempts to secure skilled jobs.In 2000 the Red Dragon Project began, aimed at modernising the ageing MoD facilities there, along with the construction of a £77m super hangar for fast jet repair.The main tenant for the new super hangar was to be the Defence Aviation Repair Agency, Dara.But in 2005, UK ministers announced they were closing the fast jet business at St Athan, with the loss of hundreds of jobs.In March 2009 the National Audit Office and the Wales Audit Office criticised both the MoD and Welsh authorities after it had cost the taxpayer £113m and failed to deliver thousands of jobs.The then Defence Minister Quentin Davies revealed in November 2009 that nearly 340 jobs would be lost at the base in south Wales by June 2013 at the latest.In October 2010, a £14bn defence training academy which would have created 2,000 jobs at St Athan was scrapped as part of 8% cuts by the UK government to the defence budget.At that time there were around 400 civilian staff left at the base.But the operation has been gradually wound down as the contract to service the VC-10 tanker aircraft came to an end.Mr Lindsay added: \"The buildings are there. It's available. Let's hope somebody else comes. \"The Welsh government said there was significant private sector interest in the newly designated St Athan Enterprise Zone.It said it was working to attract new companies to the area capable of creating sustainable jobs for local people.A spokesman said Cardiff Airport and other key employment sites and development proposals in the immediate vicinity were now being included in the enterprise zone. \"Potential employers are made aware of the skills mix available,\" said the spokesperson.",

The closure of the base marks the end of an era for the region which has been a hub for aircraft maintenance and repair for decades. The VC10, an iconic British aircraft has been a familiar sight in the airfield for many years and its departure is a poignant reminder of the changing landscape of aviation industry. Workers and local residents gathered to bid farewell to an era. Many were emotional, having spent their entire careers at the base. \"It's a sad day, but we are proud of what we have done here,\" said one worker who wanted to remain anonymous. \"We have worked on some of the most iconic aircraft in the world and have always been proud to call this place home. The future of the site remains uncertain, but there are hopes that it could be redeveloped as a new enterprise zone and attract new businesses and jobs to the area. The Welsh Government has expressed support for the idea and talks are continuing with potential investors. In the meantime, the workers who lost their jobs will be supported through a comprehensive package of training and employment services to help them find new opportunities in the region. As one worker said, \"We may be saying goodbye to VC10, but we're not saying goodbye to our skills and expertise. We'll be back and we'll be flying high again soon.\" The closure of the base also sparked a wave of nostalgia among locals, who shared fond memories of seeing the VC10s take off and land at the airfield. \"I remember lying in the bed at night and listening to the sound of the VC10s flying overhead,\" said local resident Margaret Evans. \"It was music to my ears. It is hard to believe it all is coming to an end. The base has also played a significant role in the region’s history, serving as a key maintenance hub during times of war and peace. \"The base has been so long a part of our community that it's hard to imagine it not being there,\" said local historian, John Davies. \"But we're proud of the role that it's played in our history and we'll make sure to preserve its legacy for future generations. Until the last remnants of the base's operations are dismantled, attention is now turning to the future of the site. The Welsh government's proposal to redevelop the area as an enterprise zone was met with enthusiasm from local business leaders who see it as an opportunity to attract new investment and jobs to the region. \"We are excited about the potential to be revived as a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship for this site\", said Ian Jones, chairman of the local chamber of commerce.",

Other video streaming services remain an important part of our business plan to ensure we bring the best of British to our audiences,\" she said.Lord Hall said he hoped to boost the income of BBC Worldwide to Â£1.2bn over the next five years, to help fund new BBC programmes. \"We need to raise commercial income to supplement the licence fee so we can invest as much as possible in content for UK audiences,\" he said. \"Without that income, we can't continue what we already do for the UK in drama or natural history. \"One analyst told the BBC a streaming service may not be the \"ray of light\" the corporation wanted. \"There is growth in online video and consumers are willing to pay a small sum to access entertainment online,\" said TV analyst Michael Underhill from Enders Analysis. \"But the BBC trialled an international version of its iPlayer service in a number of countries for four years.

Industry experts believe that the service would likely appeal to a niche audience of Anglophiles and fans of British television. The BBC has a strong brand and loyal audience in the United States, and this service would allow them to tap into that,\" said Tom Harrington, a media analyst. It is unlikely to appeal to a mass audience and would probably be a niche offering. The new service would not affect the BBC's existing contracts with other streaming services such as Amazon and Hulu, which currently offer a variety of BBC content to their subscribers. The new platform would instead offer a dedicated BBC-branded service, with a curated selection of content that showcases the best of British television.

He said that Gray was acting \"irate\" and \"aggressive\" during the arrest, but did not appear to be injured. Porter said he checked Gray at each of the six stops and Gray did not indicate that he was in distress or needed medical attention. Porter acknowledged that at one point Gray had requested that he be taken to a hospital but said he did not think that it was a valid request. \"I didn't think it was a medical emergency,\" said Porter. \"He was able to talk, able to breathe and able to move. \"Porter's testimony contradicts that of other witnesses, who have said that Gray was visibly injured and in distress during the transport process. Prosecutors have argued that Porter and the other officers were negligent in their treatment of Gray and that their failure to provide medical attention contributed to his death.The trial, which began last week, is expected to continue for several more days. When convicted of manslaughter, assault and misconduct in office, Porter faces up to 10 years in prison. The case has sparked widespread attention and sparked protests and calls for police reform in Baltimore and beyond. Gray's death was one of several high-profile cases of police brutality in 2015, and helped fuel the Black Lives Matter movement.",

Can you see anything?Now look at the photograph below before taking another look. Scientists say it is likely that you can now make sense of it.It is the brain's ability to fill in the blanks that could help explain why some people suffer from hallucinations.One of the study's authors, Dr Christoph Teufel, from Cardiff University, said: \"Vision is a constructive process - in other words, our brain makes up the world that we 'see'. \"It fills in the blanks, ignoring the things that don't quite fit, and presents to us an image of the world that has been edited and made to fit with what we expect. \"An example of this would be a person walking into their living room and identifying a fast-moving black shape as their cat, despite the fact the visual information was no more than a blur.The sensory input was minimal and prior knowledge did the creative work.Prof Paul Fletcher of the University of Cambridge said: \"Having a predictive brain is very useful - it makes us efficient and adept at creating a coherent picture of an ambiguous and complex world. \"But it also means that we are not very far away from perceiving things that aren't actually there, which is the definition of a hallucination. \"He added that \"altered perceptual experiences\" are not limited to people with mental illnesses, but have been seen in a milder form across the whole population.",

In people with psychosis, this process can go awry, leading to hallucinations and distorted perceptions of reality. The researchers found that individuals with early signs of psychosis were more likely to over-rely on their prior knowledge and predictions when interpreting the confusing images. This led to a greater improvement in their ability to recognize the images after seeing the full-color original compared to the healthy control group. \"This suggests that people with psychosis may be more likely to fill in the gaps with their own predictions than to rely on the actual sensory information '', Dr. Garrison said. \"This could contribute to the development of hallucinations and other symptoms of psychosis. \"The findings of the study have significant implications for the treatment of psychosis. By targeting the predictive mechanisms of the brain, researchers may be able to develop new therapies that help individuals with psychosis to better distinguish between the reality and their own internal predictions. \"This is a promising area of research, as it suggests we could develop treatments that are more targeted and effective than current approaches,\" said Dr. Subramaniam. \"We're excited to continue exploring this area and see where it can lead in terms of improving outcomes for people with psychosis.

In the meantime, Mr. Carmichael remains in his position as MP for Orkney and Shetland, despite the controversy surrounding him. It remains to be seen whether he will be able to regain the trust of his constituents and continue to serve as their MP.",

About 90% of the plants and animals that evolved here do not occur anywhere else in the world, which means they are endemic to Hawaii. \"If they are lost from Hawaii, they are pretty much lost to the planet. \"The invasive plants are dramatically reducing the volume of fresh water available for native species.The Australian tree fern is able to penetrate remote areas of the native forest because it is dispersed via spores carried by the wind, making it difficult to be tracked and located on the ground.In order to overcome this obstacle, TNC has teamed up with satellite imaging firm DigitalGlobe to call on web users to scan and spot the invasive species in images posted on the web.The images, provided by Resources Mapping, are aerial photos providing 1cm per pixel.Luke Barrington, senior manager for DigitalGlobe's crowdsourcing platform, said the high-quality, natural colour images had enabled web users to identify the invasive species.He explained: \"The connectivity of billions of people online is transforming  the way that the globe solves global problems. Millions of people are coming together to solve a problem. \"The campaign has been running since June and each pixel of the images available has been accessed by at least 50 users, providing a built-in level of quality control.",

We've been blown away by the enthusiasm and dedication of our volunteers, who have spent thousands of hours studying these images and helping us to better understand the extent of the problem. The Australian tree fern, a non-native species introduced as an ornamental plant to Hawaii, has been identified as a major culprit in the depletion of Hawaii's native forests. By outselling native plants for water, the fern is not only altering the environment, but also exacerbating the effects of drought and climate change. The collected data will be used to inform conservation efforts and develop targeted strategies for reducing the spread of invasive species. \"This project is a game-changing for conservation in Hawaii,\" said Dr. Stewart. \"We're not only gathering valuable data and raising awareness about the importance of protecting our unique and fragile ecosystems by engaging the public in this way. As the project gains momentum, researchers are hopeful that it will serve as a model for similar initiatives around the world. They think it is possible to make a significant impact on the conservation of native ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity with the help of citizen scientists.",

We didn't have the intensity and urgency needed to win the game. \"The visitors, Queen of the South, took the lead through Mark Millar in the 35th minute, who scored against his former club. The goal was a result of some poor defending from Dundee United and seemed to spark the home team into life. Van der Velden's equalizer in the 55th minute was a highlight of the match as he flicked the ball past two defenders before lying down just before the goalkeeper. The goal seemed to give Dundee United a boost, and they began to create more chances despite their dominance. However, they were unable to find a winner. Both Cammy Smith and Tope Obadeyi had chances, but were denied by some excellent goalkeeping from Lee Robinson. At the other end, Dundee United goalkeeper Cammy Bell was also called into action, making some crucial saves to prevent Queen of the South from re-taking the lead.The match ended 1-1, a result that left both teams frustrated. Dundee United will be disappointed to not have taken all three points, while Queen of the South will feel that they could have won the game if they had taken their chances. The draw leaves Dundee United in 5th position in the Scottish Championship, while Queen of the South remain in 7th place. Both teams look to improve their form in their next matches, with Dundee United faced a tough trip to Falkirk and Queen of the South was denied a goal by a brilliant blockby from Cammy Bell. The former Bolton striker was returning to Palmerston where he scored 54 times in 103 games during his first spell with the club.

According to Ms. Holland the Welsh government should tackle bullying with equal vigor and it is a legal responsibility for schools to have anti-bullying policies in place. However, in some cases the guidelines are gathering dust on school shelves, with little evidence of their reading or implementation. \"I want to see guidelines that are truly useful, that build on children's experiences and give them answers, but also tell schools how to monitor bullying and not be afraid of it,\" said Ms. Holland. The findings of a survey of over 1,000 children and young people have revealed that nearly half had experienced bullying in the past year. The most common forms of bullying were verbal abuse, social exclusion and online harassment. Holland calls for a more proactive approach to bullying, including better training for teachers and support staff, as well as more effective reporting mechanisms. She also wants to see schools working more closely with parents and the wider community to create a culture of zero tolerance towards bullying. However, opposition parties have criticised the government's response, saying that more needs to be done to address the root causes of bullying and to provide appropriate support to victims. The report's findings have sparked a larger debate about the need for a more comprehensive approach to tackling bullying in Wales, with many calling for a national anti-bullying strategy to be developed. The findings of the report sparked a wave of concern among parents, educators and policy makers, with many calling for swift action to address the issue. According to Ms. Holland, the lack of consistency in handling bullying complaints is not only damaging for the children involved, but also undermines the entire education system. \"When children are bullied, they are more likely to miss school, underperform academically, and experience long-term mental health problems,\" said Holland. It's not just a matter of personal well-being ; it's also a matter of social justice. Every child deserves an education free of fear and intimidation. \"The report's recommendations include the development of a national antibullying strategy that would provide a framework for schools to deal with bullying in a comprehensive and consistent manner.",

According to police reports, Heaggan-Brown stopped Smith's vehicle after noticing that it was driving erratically. When Smith fled the scene on foot, Heaggan-Brown and another officer chased back. The shooting was captured on body camera footage which showed that Smith was unarmed and had thrown his gun away before being shot. Later the footage was released to the public, sparking outrage and demands for Heaggan-Brown to be arrested and charged in December 2016 in connection with Smith's death. The case drew national attention and many saw it as another example of police brutality and racial injustice. In June 2017, Heaggan-Brown began his trial with prosecutors arguing that the officer had acted recklessly and unnecessarily in shooting Smith. On the other hand, the defense claimed that Heaggan-Brown acted in self-defense, fearing his life when Smith reached for his waistband. After deliberating for several hours, the jury delivered a verdict that shocked many: not guilty. Heaggan-Brown was acquitted of all charges, sparking widespread outrage and protests in Milwaukee and beyond. The acquittal was seen by many as a miscarriage of justice, and it sparked renewed calls for police reform and accountability. The case remains a controversial and painful reminder of the ongoing battles with racism and police violence in the United States. Following the acquittal, protests erupted in Milwaukee, with demonstrators blocking streets and chanting slogans such as \"Justice for Sylville\" and \"Black Lives Matter\". The protests were largely peaceful but some incidents of vandalism and property damage were reported. Community leaders and activists expressed outrage and disappointment at the verdict, saying that it sent a message that police officers could act with impunity and that black lives were not valued. \"This verdict is a slap in the face to the Smith family and to the entire community,\" said Milwaukee NAACP President Fred Royal.

The issue has sparked a wider debate on the relationship of the UK to the EU and the level of control that member states have over their own tax policies. Eurosceptics argue that the EU VAT rules are an example of Brussels overreach and that the UK should be able to set its own tax rates without interference from the EU. Supporters of the EU argue that the Harmonization of VAT rates helps create a level playing field across the single market and prevents member states from engaging in unfair tax competition. The dispute over VAT rates comes as the UK prepares to vote in June on its membership in the EU. The Brexit campaign seized on the issue as an example of EU interference in UK affairs, while the Leave campaign claims that the UK's membership in the EU brings economic benefits and that the EU is willing to work with the UK to address its concerns. The European Commission's proposal to give Member States more flexibility over VAT rates is seen as a concession to the UK and other member states that have called for greater autonomy over their tax policies. However, it remains to be seen whether the proposal will be sufficient to satisfy the demands of the UK and whether it will have any effect on the outcome of the EU referendum. In the meantime the debate on VAT rates is likely to continue with the Labour motion on Monday just the first salvo in a larger battle over the UK relationship with the EU and its tax policies. The Labour motion, which is expected to be debated in the House of Commons on Monday, calls for the government to \"take immediate action to address the unfairness of VAT on sanitary products\" and to \"work with the European Commission to secure a change to EU VAT rules to allow members to zero-rate essential items such as sanitary products\". The motion has gained significant cross-party support, with at least 12 Conservative MPs signing on, in addition to Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs. The issue sparked a wider debate about the UK relationship with the EU and the level of control that the member states have over their own tax policies. Eurosceptics argue that the EU VAT rules are an example of Brussels' overreach and that the UK should be able to set its own tax rates without interference from the EU. \"This is a classic example of EU intervention in our domestic affairs,\" said Conservative MP and Eurosceptic, John Redwood.",

Many hospitals and clinics lack basic medical supplies and equipment and access to healthcare remains a major issue, especially in rural areas. The Liberian government has made efforts to revitalize the economy which is largely dependent on agriculture and natural resources. However, corruption and mismanagement remain major obstacles to progress, and the country continues to rely heavily on international aid. In recent years, Liberia has made some progress in improving its education system with the number of children enrolled in school increasing significantly. However, many schools still lack basic resources such as textbooks and qualified teachers and the quality of education remains a major concern. Despite these challenges, Liberia has made significant strides to promote peace and stability in the region. The country has played a key role in regional organisations, such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and has contributed troops to international peacekeeping missions. In addition, Liberia has made efforts to promote tourism, with its rich cultural heritage and natural beauty making it an attractive destination for visitors. The country is home to several national parks, including Sapo National Park which is one of the largest remaining tropical rainforests in West Africa.Overall, while Liberia still faces many challenges, the country has made significant progress in recent years and its people remain hopeful for a brighter future. With sustained international support and investment, Liberia has the potential to become a stable and prosperous nation and a beacon of hope for the region. Despite the progress, Liberia still faces numerous challenges that hinder its development. Infrastructure in the country, including roads, bridges and ports, is in dire need of repair and upgrading. The lack of reliable electricity and access to clean water remains also a major issue, especially in rural areas. The Liberian economy is still heavily dependent on foreign aid, which can be unpredictable and subject to fluctuations. The country's agricultural sector which is a significant contributor to the economy is vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters such as floods and droughts. The justice system in Liberia is still in the process of being rebuilt and corruption remains a major problem.",

The potential of these innovations to revolutionize the way we lived, worked and communicated was palpable, yet the uncertainty surrounding their impact on society was equally profound. I remember the excitement around the introduction of the IBM PC in 1981, which marked a significant turning point in the democratization of computing. The idea that individuals could now own a machine capable of doing tasks previously reserved for mainframe computers was a game changer, and the media played a crucial role in explaining the significance of this development to a curious public. Also in the late 1980s and the early 1990s the advent of the Internet was met by a flurry of articles, editorials and feature pieces that sought to demystify this newfangled network of networks. The potential for global connectivity, instant access to information and the dawn of a new era of digital communication were all hot topics of discussion as the media struggled to keep pace with the rapid evolution of this technology.Then there was the World Wide Web, which burst onto the scene in the early 1990s and forever changed the way we interact with information. The intuitive interface of the Web, coupled with the proliferation of browsers such as Netscape and Internet Explorer, made it possible for masses to access and share information on an unprecedented scale. Throughout these pivotal moments, the media played a vital role in shaping public perception and understanding of these emerging technologies. In many ways, the media's coverage of these technological milestones helped to fuel the imagination of the public and inspires a new generation of innovators, entrepreneurs and thinkers to explore the possibilities of the digital age.",

The Philippines had brought the case to the tribunal in 2013 arguing that China's claims were a violation of international law. China has consistently rejected the ruling, calling it \"uncontested\" and vowing to ignore it. Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea and is locked in disputes with several other nations, including Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei. The Philippines' stance has been welcomed by other countries in the region, who have long been wary of China's growing military presence in the South China Sea. The United States has in particular been vocal in supporting the Philippines and calling on China to respect the ruling and refrain from further militarization of the disputed waters. The standoff has raised concerns about the potential for conflict in the region, with some analysts warning that China's actions could lead to a military confrontation. The Philippines has said that it is open to dialogue with China, but only if it is based on international law principles and respect for the ruling of the tribunal. As tensions continue to simmer, the international community is watching closely to see how the situation will unfold.

There should just be one class on the train. \"\"People will see less first class in the future as we start to say that on busy suburban trains you can't start segregating,\" he added.The Department for Transport issues contracts to run rail franchises in England, and can include conditions such as whether first class seating should be provided.In March, ahead of contract negotiations to run the Southeastern franchise, passengers were asked if they wanted to remove first class seats at busy times.The contract to run the line - which serves south-east London, Kent and parts of East Sussex - expires next year.Other franchises to be renewed in the next 12 months include the West Coast Main Line from April 2019, and the East Midlands regional contract, which has three firms bidding to run the contract from March 2018.However, some are not due for renewal for several years, with the Northern and East Anglia franchises currently not due for renewal until 2025.David Sidebottom, director of Transport Focus - which represents passengers - said it was important train users have a choice, \"as long as that choice is not to the extreme detriment of everyone else\". \"A balance needs to be achieved between the number of standard and first class carriages a train has,\" he added. \"However, it is clear that where passengers are being squeezed into standard class carriages while there are plenty of empty seats in first class, this balance is not being achieved. \"In the long-term we need a big increase in capacity. This means continued investment in new and longer trains to meet existing demand. \"Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group - which represents train operators - said firms were prepared to work with the government over the issue. \"We understand passengers' frustration when they can't get a seat which is why rail companies are working together to invest and improve journeys with thousands of new carriages and 6,400 extra train services a week by 2021,\" he said. \"We will continue to work with governments to increase seats on key routes to boost communities, businesses and the economy.\"",

        "text": "In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Grayling stated that he is \"absolutely\" committed to scrapping first-class carriages on shorter commuter routes during peak times, suggesting that operators will be forced to make changes when franchises are awarded in the future. Grayling argues that busy trains should have only a class of seats to maximize capacity. The Transport Secretary believes that this change would allow more passengers to be accommodated during rush hour, alleviating pressure on the network. While a populist move to address the frustrations of commuters was expressed by the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, the issue remains to be understood about how it will be received by passengers who value the extra comfort and amenities provided by first-class travel. The proposal to scrap First Class carriages on shorter commuter routes has sparked a heated debate among commuters, transport experts and train operators. While some have welcomed the move as a necessary step to combat overcrowding, others have expressed concerns about the potential impact on passenger comfort and the financial viability of train operators. One of the main concerns is that the abolition of first-class seating would result in a loss of revenue for train operators which could have a knock-on effect on the quality of services and the ability to invest in infrastructure. The Rail Delivery Group has warned that the removal of first-class seats could result in a significant revenue reduction which could be detrimental to the long-term sustainable growth of the rail network. First class seating often provides additional legroom, quieter carriages, and complimentary food and drink services, which are extremely valued by many commuters.",

The Bluebirds came from behind to win the game, with Greg Halford scoring in the 113th minute against his former club.Portsmouth, led by new owner Michael Eisner, had taken the lead in the first half by an own goal by Sean Morrison. However, Nathaniel Mendez-Laing’s goal just minutes into the second half shifted the momentum in favor of the hosts back, neither team could find a winner in regular time, putting the match in extra time. The first half of extra time was scoreless but Halford sealed the victory for Cardiff City in the 113th minute.The victory marks a significant turnaround for Cardiff City, which had struggled in their previous matches. Manager Neil Warnock will be happy with the team’s resilience and determination, especially in the face of adversity. For Portsmouth, the defeat marks a disappointing end to their Carabao Cup campaign. Despite a promising start, the team was unable to hold on to their lead and ultimately fell short.The victory sets up a mouth-watering tie for Cardiff City in the next round with the Bluebirds looking to continue their cup run. Meanwhile Portsmouth will focus on their League One campaign where they will look to bounce back from this defeat. Warnock's men will now face a tough test in the next round when they take on the Premier League outfit of Middlesbrough. The tie is set to be played at Riverside Stadium and Cardiff City will be trying to cause an upset against their top players. Despite the win, Warnock was quick to praise Portsmouth's performance, recognising that they had given his team a run for their money. \"Portsmouth were a tough opponent, and we knew that it was going to be a difficult game,\" Warnock said at his post-match press conference. They had some great chances and we had to work hard to get the win. I'm proud of the boys for showing their character and determination to come from behind and win the game. The Portsmouth manager Kenny Jackett was left to regret his team's missed chances but was proud of his players' effort.",

However, after speaking with another MS patient who has received support from the NHS, Campbell is now reconsidering his decision to end his life. The other patient who wishes to remain anonymous, shared their own experiences of struggling with the condition and encouraged Campbell to press for more help from the NHS. In response to Campbell's initial decision, NHS Highland issued a statement saying that support for patients with MS is tailored to individual needs and that they strive to provide the best possible care for those affected by the condition. Campbell's initial decision to travel to a Swiss clinic sparked a wider debate about end of life care and the support available to those with terminal illnesses.Campbell's change of heart has been welcomed by campaigners who argue that more needs to be done to support those with MS and other life-limiting conditions They believe that many people can live fulfilling lives with the right care and support despite their illness. The development has also raised questions about the need for greater investment in palliative care and support services for those with terminal illnesses. While Campbell's decision is a personal one, it highlights the importance of providing adequate support and care for those who need it most.As the debate continues, Campbell’s story serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of compassion, empathy and support for those with life-limiting conditions. The Scottish government has since responded to Campbell's story, stating they are committed to improving the care and support for people with MS and other terminal illnesses. A spokesperson said: \"We acknowledge the importance of providing palliative care and support services to those who need it the most. We will continue to work with healthcare professionals, charities and patient groups to ensure that people with life-limiting conditions receive the care and support they deserve.

However its review of whether he received a fair trial has been in limbo because the British courts won't disclose the secret material.In a unanimous judgement on Wednesday, a Supreme Court panel of seven judges backed that decision - saying English courts could block disclosure on national security grounds, even if the material was at the heart of an appeal.Lord Mance, the lead judge on the panel of seven, said: \"The appellant has not made good the proposition which he needs to establish, namely that there are no circumstances in which refusal to permit disclosure of the in-camera [secret] material to the European Court of Human Rights in the appellant's response could be justified. \"Under the international rules governing the European Court, each state promises not to stand in the way of anyone who wants to seek its help.But the Supreme Court said the long-established block on revealing national security material did not compromise that principle. It won't be clear for some months whether Strasbourg agrees.",

The original trial was kept in secret with large parts of the proceedings held behind closed doors. At the time, the judge used unspecified security reasons and witness security reasons for the unusual move. Yam's lawyers have been fighting to overturn his conviction, arguing that the secrecy surrounding the trial was unjustified and violated his right to a fair trial. They had taken their case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, but the Supreme Court case has thrown a flag in the air. The Supreme Court's decision has sparked concerns about the potential for cases to be blocked on security grounds. Human rights groups have expressed alarm by warning that the decision could set a dangerous precedent and undermine the right to a fair trial. The lawyers are now carefully considering their next move, weighing up whether to continue with their appeal to Europe or to pursue other avenues. \"This is a complex and highly unusual decision and we need to take the time to fully understand its implications,\" said a spokesperson for Yam's team.The case has generated widespread interest not least because of the mysterious circumstances surrounding Mr Chappelow's death. The 86-year-old author was found dead at his Hampstead home in June 2006, many weeks after he had been killed. The investigation that followed was one of the most extensive and complex in recent history and involved forensic experts from around the world. As the legal battle continues, many are left wondering what secrets the case may still hold and whether justice will ultimately be served. The decision of the Supreme Court has also raised questions about the role of national security in the justice system. Critics argue that the decision sets a worrying precedent, allowing the government to cite security concerns to restrict access to justice and undermine the principles of transparency and accountability. \"This ruling is a blow to the rule of law and the principles of fair trial,\" said Sarah Jones, a human rights lawyer with the organization Liberty.",

The emergency services were quickly called to the scene and Christina was rushed to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead.The 22-year-old suspect, who has not been named, was arrested shortly after the attack and is currently in police custody. Detectives are working to establish a motive for the attack, but so far no one has been revealed. \"This is a tragic and senseless act of violence,\" said Det Supt Richard Baker. \"Our thoughts are with Christina's family and friends who are going through an unimaginable ordeal. We will do everything in our power to bring the auteur to justice. The attack sent shockwaves through the community, with many taking to social media to pay tribute to Christina. A Facebook page she created in her memory has already gained thousands of likes, with friends and classmates sharing fond memories of the teenager.Leasowes High School announced that it will be closed for the rest of the day, with counseling for students and staff available. Headteacher Neil Shaw said that Christina was a \"Bright and Popular Student\" who would be greatly missed. \"This is a devastating loss for our school community,\" said Mr. Shaw. \"Christina was a lovely girl who was always smiling and had a kind word for everyone. In this difficult time, we will do everything we can to support her family and her friends. The investigation into Christina's death is ongoing with police appealing for anyone with information to come forward.",

        "text": "The contact wrought havoc in the health of indigenous populations.David Kipping and Alex Teachey from Columbia University in New York say that if we are fearful of a similar outcome from an alien encounter then lasers offer a solution.The team has calculated what would be required to cloak the Earth and published the concept in a paper in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.It \"perverts\" the technique scientists already use now to look for distant planets around other stars. This method relies on staring at these suns, hoping to catch an object passing in front. When such a \"transit\" occurs, there is a tell-tale decrease in starlight.The US space agency's Kepler telescope has identified more than a thousand planets this way.If intelligent civilisations are out there, it is safe to assume they too will be looking for other worlds - like ours - using the same idea, believe Kipping and Teachey.According to the pair's calculations, emitting a continuous 30-megawatt laser for about 10 hours, once a year, would be enough to distort the characteristic dip in light when Earth transited the Sun, as viewed from an alien Kepler telescope. \"It doesn't have to be one huge laser; it could be an array positioned around the Earth. Or you could put it in space as a satellite, and we've calculated that the International Space Station already collects exactly the amount of energy we would need,\" Prof Kipping told BBC News.This is true for a laser system working in visible light. Prof Kipping concedes, however, that a laser cloak that covers all wavelengths, not just the visible colours, would need a very large array of tuneable lasers with a total power of 250MW.But an alternative might be to use a laser simply to disguise the interesting aspects about Earth - features in its atmosphere that betray the fact that life exists here. These are a suite of gases that include oxygen, ozone and methane. \"If we just cloaked out those biosignatures then another civilisation might detect our planet through a transit, everything would add up, but Earth would appear as a dead world and they'd soon lose interest,\" Prof Kipping added.The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (Seti) is the collective term used to describe positive efforts to detect and contact alien life. A number of experiments are currently under way that are trying to see if aliens are actually signalling us with lasers.But just as with the attempts to detect the radio transmissions from aliens, this \"optical Seti\" approach, as it is known, has also found nothing of interest among the starsâ€¦ yet.",

The proposal to use powerful laser beams to counteract the dimming effect of Earth's transit across the Sun's disk has sparked a heated debate among scientists and astronomers. While some argue that the potential benefits of contact with other intelligent life forms outweigh the risks, others believe that the consequences of such an action could be catastrophic. \"This is a reckless and irresponsible idea,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a leading astrobiologist. We have no idea what kind of civilizations are out there or what their intentions might be. We could invite disaster by broadcasting our presence to the universe. \"Proponents of the plan however, argue that the likelihood of hostile aliens visiting Earth is low and that the potential benefits of contact with other intelligent life forms could be enormous. \"Imagine the possibilities of interstellar cooperation and knowledge sharing,\" said Dr. John Taylor, a physicist at Harvard University. We could learn so much from each other, and potentially form alliances that could benefit the whole humanity as a whole. While the controversy is over, researchers push forward with the plan, which they claim can be implemented using existing technology. The proposal has provoked a larger conversation about ethics of astrobiology and the responsibility that comes from exploring the universe. As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the decision to broadcast our existence to the galaxy is not to be taken lightly. The fate of humanity depends on it. As the debate continues to unfold, experts from various fields weigh in on the potential consequences of broadcasting the existence of Earth to the universe. Dr. Sophia Patel, a renowned astrophysicist, cautioned that even if the likelihood of hostile aliens is low, the risks of the unintended consequences are still significant. The potential for cultural contamination, technological disruption, and even the exploitation of our planet's resources is not just talking about hostile aliens. We need to consider the long-term implications of our actions and ensure that we are not putting humanity at risk. On the other hand, Dr. Taylor and his supporters argue that the benefits of making contact with other intelligent life forms far outweigh the risks. They point out the potential for interstellar cooperation, knowledge sharing and even the possibility of receiving aid from advanced civilizations in times of crisis. \"Imagine if we were facing a global catastrophe, such as a massive asteroid impact or a devastating pandemic\", said Dr. Taylor. For example, with allies in the galaxy, survival could be the difference between extinction and survival. \"As the scientific community continues to debate the merits of the proposal, governments and international organizations are also beginning to take notice.",

But by paying them it is the asylum seekers who become the real enemy while people smugglers can help us out by turning their boats back,\" he explains. \"It is the ultimate PR triumph. \"Others think Mr Abbott is testing the public's appetite for tougher action on asylum seekers.The government will be wondering whether people are willing to let them stop the boats at any cost, says political scientist in the School of Social Sciences at Monash University, Dr Zareh Ghazarian.By using phrases such as \"by hook or by crook\", Mr Abbott is reminding people how far he is willing to go to deliver on his election promise to stop the boats, says Dr Ghazarian, without committing himself on the payment issue. \"Asylum seekers and stopping the boats is arguably the government's one political achievement,\" he says. \"If they can't manage the asylum seeker issue and the boats start arriving again in the numbers we have seen in past years they will have lost credibility on this issue. \"Social commentator and writer Jane Caro agrees. \"Stopping the boats is the only real success story for the government to hang its hat on,\" says Ms Caro, noting that it is a policy that remains popular with most Australians. \"I am speculating but Mr Abbott will be thinking that eventually [stopping the boats] will get tougher and he is not willing to remove anything from his bag of tricks,\" she says. \"Here is a prime minister who is reserving his options.\"",

The Australian Prime Minister's comments have sparked outrage among human rights groups and opposition parties that have accused the government of corruption and putting lives at risk. \"This is a shocking admission by the Prime Minister\", said Sarah Hanson-Young, a senator from the Australian Greens Party. \"Paying people smugglers to turn back asylum seekers is not only illegal, but it's also morally reprehensible. It's a clear breach of international law and puts lives at risk. The High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) also expressed concern over the allegations and said that paying people smugglers could lead to more dangerous and exploitative practices. \"We are concerned about actions that may incentivize or facilitate people smuggling, which can lead to tragic consequences, said a UNHCR spokeswoman. \"We encourage all countries to work together to find safe and legal solutions for asylum seekers and refugees, rather than resorting to dangerous and illegal practices. The Australian government has faced criticism in the past for its tough attitude towards asylum seekers, including its policy of ensnare them in offshore processing centers. The government has defended its policies, saying they are necessary to prevent deaths at sea and to protect the country's borders. The latest allegations have sparked renewed calls for the government to reconsider its approach to asylum seekers. \"This is a clear example of the government's morally disastrous approach to asylum seekers,\" said Daniel Webb, a lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre. It is time for the government to stop playing politics with people's lives and to work towards a humane and compassionate solution. The Australian Government has refused to comment further on the allegations, citing operational security concerns. The controversy is likely to continue to dominate the headlines in the coming days, however, as the public and opposition parties demand more answers about government dealings with people smugglers.",

He was known for his role in leading the IS forces in Syria and Iraq, and was considered one of the most senior and feared commanders of the group. The US had been tracking Shishani for months and had previously attempted to target him in airstrikes. If confirmed, his death would be a significant blow to IS, which has suffered a series of setbacks in recent months, including the loss of key territory in Iraq and Syria.Shishani's rise to prominence in IS was marked by his brutal tactics and his ability to inspire loyalty among his followers. He was known for his use of social media to promote IS ideology and recruit new members and was considered one of the group's most effective propagandists. The US Department of State had offered a $5 million reward for information that led to Shishani's capture or death and he was designated as a specially designated global terrorist in September 2014. The strike that targeted Shishani is the latest in a series of US air strikes against IS leaders and commanders. In recent months, the US has stepped up its fight against IS, launching a series of airstrikes and special operations raids aimed at disrupting the group's command structure and weakening its ability to operate. The US military has not yet released any further details about the strike, and it is unclear whether the body of Shishani has been recovered or identified.

        "text": "The researchers found that as females aged postmenopausally they become increasingly interested and helpful in raising their grandchildren and providing them with essential care and support. This phenomenon is not unique to humans, as similar patterns have been observed in females of great apes and toothed whales (cetaceans), which also show extended lifespans beyond their reproductive years. The \"grandmother hypothesis\" was first proposed in the 1950s, but this new study provides further evidence to support the theory. According to the researchers, the extended lifespan of postmenopausal females may have evolved as a result of their ability to provide critical support to their grandchildren, increasing their chances of survival and success.In many species, including humans, grandmothers play a vital role in childcare, providing food, protection and wisdom to their grandchildren. This support can be particularly crucial during times of scarcity or suffering when experience and knowledge of the grandmother can mean the difference between life and death. The findings of the study have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of life in females. As their grandchildren received a clear benefit, post-menopausal females could have been able to extend their lives, allowing them to continue to contribute to their families and communities. The researchers hope that their study will inspire further research into the role of grandmothers in different species and the ways in which they contribute to the survival and success of their families. As one of the researchers noted: \"The grandmother hypothesis is a powerful reminder of the importance of intergenerational relationships and the critical role that older women play in the lives of their grandchildren.\"",

I wouldn't discount him doing that for a year or two, then returning. \"Alonso, who signed a three-year contract with the British team after leaving Ferrari, has managed a 12th and 11th placing so far this season - though both the driver and McLaren say they are confident there will be an improvement in the next race, the Spanish Grand Prix on 10 May.However, there have been suggestions the relationship between Alonso and the team has already become strained.The Spaniard blamed the steering for a crash in pre-season testing that left him in hospital for three days, and resulted in him missing the opening race in Australia. McLaren denied there was a problem. \"He was thinking moving back to McLaren would be very good, and the salary must have been part of the reason. For some reason they are not doing well,\" added Piquet Jr, now competing in Formula E, having raced with Alonso at Renault in 2008 and 2009. \"He's paid a lot of money to do what he does best and he wants to deliver. But when there are no means to do it you will have a very frustrated person. \"Alonso returned for a second spell at McLaren after five years with Ferrari, where he failed to land a third Formula 1 drivers' title.The Italian team finished fourth in the constructors' championship in 2014, but seem more competitive this season and sit second behind Mercedes. \"Fernando is the best driver out there,\" said Piquet Jr, son of Brazilian three-time F1 world champion Nelson Piquet.Referring to Lewis Hamilton winning his first title with McLaren in 2008 after Alonso left for Renault, he added: \"I think it gets a bit annoying when it's the second time he's changed a team, and the team he has left has done well. \"It's not his fault.

Since returning to McLaren in 2015, the Spaniard has faced a series of disappointing seasons, with the team's Honda-powered cars plagued with reliability issues and a lack of pace. Despite the team's switch to Renault engine this season, McLaren have not improved. Alonso's best finish so far has been 11th in Bahrain and the team's failure to score a single point in the first four races has left them at the bottom of the constructors' championship. Alonso's comments on exploring \"different priorities in life\" have led to speculation that he may be considering a move to IndyCar or even retirement altogether from Formula One. The 33-year-old has been open about his desire to win Indianapolis 500 and complete the Triple Crown of Motorsport, and some have suggested that he may be preparing to make the switch to IndyCar in the near future. McLaren officials have been quick to downplay the rumors, insisting that Alonso remains committed to the team and its goals. The Spaniards contract will expire at the end of the season, but it remains to be seen whether he will remain with McLaren or pursue other opportunities in the world of motorsport. While speculation continues to swirl around Alonso's future, McLaren team principal Zak Brown has moved to quell the rumors, stating that the team is \"fully committed\" to Alonso and working together to turn around their season. Fernando is a key part of our team and we are working closely together to get the results we want,\" Brown said in a statement. \"We understand his frustration but we all are in this together and we are confident that we can turn things around. \"Despite Brown's assurances, many in the paddock believe that Alonso's comments are a clear indication that he is tired of McLaren's struggles and considering his options.",

It's the 100m final.Usain has looked good so far during the competition. He's been among the fastest sprinters in the qualifying rounds.As he get ready for the final, the Jamaican does his famous lightning bolt pose and the crowd cheers.On your marks, set, go!Usain springs out of the blocks but then the starter's gun goes off. That's not what's supposed to happen.Disaster, it's a false start!A false start happens when an athlete begins a race before the official signal has been given.They can't start running until after the starter's gun has been fired.The Jamaican sprinter is well known for starting his races slowly. Some scientists think this is because Bolt is so tall, making it hard for him to get up to full speed quickly.He makes up for the slower starts with his long strides catching other racers further down the track.Normally, judging by all the gold medals he's won, his slow start clearly doesn't cause him any problems.Usain said: \"I have worked hard on my start all season. In the first round of the 100m it was perfect, in the second it was OK. But in the final I think I was suffering from anxiety, I was ready to go and get on the track and run. I think anxiety got the best of me. \"In the past, athletes were allowed one false start before being disqualified from a race if they did it a second time.But in 2010, new rules were introduced by the people in charge of athletics, the International Association of Athletic Federations, which disqualified athletes after just one false start.Many people did not agree with the new rules as they believed that everyone should allowed a second chance.After Bolt was disqualified from the 2011 final, his training partner Yohan Blake took gold in 9.92 seconds - 0.4 seconds slower than Bolt's world record.It wasn't the end of the Bolt's World Championships though.He went on to win the 200m and 4x100m relay with his Jamaica teammates.Usain then continued to dominate athletics for the next six years.",

Despite this minor setback, Bolts achievements on the track are nothing short of remarkable. He has broken his own world records several times and his current places of 9.58 seconds in the 100m and 19.19 seconds in the 200m are widely regarded as unbeatable. Bolt's dominance extends beyond his individual events as well. He has been an integral part of Jamaica's 4x100m relay team, helping his country to three consecutive Olympic gold medals and four World Championship titles. The 30-year-old's impact on the sport goes beyond his impressive medal tally. He has brought an intensity and charisma to athletics that has helped to globalize the sport and inspire a new generation of sprinters. As he prepares to hang up his spikes and retire from competitive racing, Bolt has already enshrined his legacy. Ohne a doubt he is the greatest sprinter of all time, and his on the track achievements will continue to inspire and awe fans for generations to come. But what next for the fastest man of the world? Bolt has hinted at a possible career in professional football and even trained with German giants Borussia Dortmund. Whatever path he chooses, one thing is definite - Usain Bolt will always be remembered as a true legend of the track. As the curtain turns on Bolt's illustrious career, the athletics world is left to think about what is next for the sport. His retirement marks the end of an era and it's difficult to imagine the track without the towering figure of the Jamaican sprinter. Bolt's legacy will live on and his impact on the sport will continue to be felt for years to come. He has inspired a new generation of athletes and his dominance has raised the bar for sprinters around the world. One athlete who is often touted as the next big thing is the American sprinter Noah Lyles. The 20-year-old has already shown impressive form, winning the 200m at the 2017 World Championships and setting a new personal best of 19.50 seconds.Lyles has often spoken about the impact Bolt has had on his career and the two have developed a close relationship.",

While a few improvements will be made next year, most of the serious spending isn't likely to happen until after 2019.But if they can get through that, they will find 19 questions to answer.Some are fairly predictable: What should be the key priorities of the new franchise, how many trains an hour should there be, do passengers value cross country services like the one between Norwich and Liverpool?But there are also some fairly contentious ones: Should first class seating be removed to allow more space for standard class passengers and should there be more staff on duty at stations and on the trains?And there are a couple of questions which are guaranteed to get respondents going. \"Are there any examples of outstanding customer service experiences which you believe the East Anglia rail franchise should  aspire to? \"Or how about this one: \"How can the franchise operator help you better during planned and unplanned disruption? \"Passengers could have a field day with that after a year that's seen a catalogue of problems on the main line through Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk.Government consultations are normally responded to by local politicians and a handful of pressure groups but already social media has been buzzing with suggestions and comments about this one.Mrs Perry is likely to have a lot of reading to do.",

And let's not forget the joys of standing room only commutes where the term \"personal space\" becomes a distant memory. But despite the potential for a barrage of criticism, the Rail Minister's request for comments is a welcome move. For too long, passengers in East Anglia felt like they were taken for granted, with promises of improvement and investment failing to materialize.So if you are a regular railway user in East Anglia, now is your chance to have your say. When the Rail Minister complains about the lack of Wi-Fi, the staggering ticketing cost, or the seemingly endless engineering works that seem to coincide with your morning commute, he wants to hear from you. Maybe – just maybe – this exercise in crowdsourcing will actually lead to some tangible improvements. The customer always has the right way, as the old adage goes. So let's make our voices heard and demand the service we deserve.The consultation period is open for the next six weeks and passengers can submit their comments online or via letter. Don't be shy – let the rail minister know what you really think about our current state of our railways. It's time to take a position and demand better. The Rail Minister's call for comments is a long-overdue opportunity for passengers to vent their frustrations and propose solutions to the myriad problems that plague the regional rail network. For years, commuters have been forced to endure delays, cancellations and overcrowding, with little more than empty promises of improvement from the authorities.But it is not only the daily grind of commuting that is the issue. The lack of investment in the regional rail infrastructure has led to a chronic shortage of seats, outdated rolling stock and a general sense of neglect. The fact that some trains don't have Wi-Fi or power outlets is a stark reminder of how far behind the times our rail network has fallen.And then there's the thorny problem of ticket prices. With fares rising year after year, many passengers are priced out of the entire rail network. It's a vicious cycle, where the only people who can afford to use the trains are those already well-off, while the rest are forced to rely on congested roads or unreliable buses. But despite the many problems there are also opportunities for improvement. With the right investment and planning, the region could transform itself into a modern, efficient, and reliable service that benefits everyone.So, what do passengers want changed?

It says that these deaths can only be attributed to the government.There were very inflated claims for the numbers of deaths in last night's assault at the beginning - figures of 200 and even higher were being discussed. But now independent and reputable human rights groups are talking about a death toll in the region of 55.However people in the worst affected suburb, Khalidiya, were describing digging 100 bodies out of the rubble, so the true figure may be somewhere in between.Across Syria a picture is emerging of government forces holding the centre of big towns and the main roads, and the Free Syrian Army becoming increasingly active and almost controlling parts of cities like Homs and areas of the countryside.These men have only very light weapons - machine-guns and rocket propelled grenades - and they have no answer when government forces decide to use heavy weapons, as they appear to have done overnight.It is a very, very bad day for Syria if the numbers are anything like even the lowest estimate.Once the death toll is established, who is responsible becomes the question.Already there are completely different accounts from the Syrian government and the Syrian opposition.Why did this take place on the day the UN Security Council was voting on a motion critic of Syria?It could be because the Free Syrian Army have been so successful that areas of Homs have slipped from the government's grasp.

They did not manage to take that base but they attacked over a number of hours and it was a big battle.I think the focus in Syria now is moving away from street protests - though they still continue - and into an escalating guerrilla campaign.",

The hospital was short on supplies, and doctors and nurses worked tirelessly to treat the injured despite the constant threat of artillery fire.

Literally, where there are stoats, New Zealand native birds do not prosper. \"And, in particular, they are really bad news for our native kiwi bird. So, where stoats are present, very few juveniles get to one year of age. In fact, probably, we lose 90% of individuals. \"In New Zealand there has been a huge campaign to trap and poison stoats. And that's sometimes been controversial, because poison is applied - albeit in a targeted fashion - by helicopter.So the hope is that once the population has been reduced you could then - counter-intuitively - introduce more stoats. But they would be secret agents with genetic modifications.For example, they may be engineered only to have male offspring and to pass that characteristic on to their progeny.So, over time, it would be harder and harder for the population to reproduce itself.Releasing genetically-engineered creatures that can't breed into the landscape - that sounds familiar. Ah, yes. It's the plot of the Jurassic Park movies. And if they've taught us anything, it is that life will find a way.I was worried Prof Gemmell might laugh at the idea. But, in fact, he took it seriously. \"Nature will find a way\", he agreed. \"And the way is normally mutation. And that was exactly what happened in Jurassic Park. \"But, he said, scientists can do a couple of things to counter-act that. \"You can put in back-up systems to make sure that the gene drive keeps working. And then, you have to go out and monitor things. You can't just walk away from it. You have to keep an eye on what's happening in the population.And he says there may be other factors that make such a scheme more difficult than expected. \"For example, what happens if female stoats don't find the male stoats that carry the damaged genes attractive, and don't want to mate with them? \"That would be a problem. And will these stoats, that have been bred in the laboratory, survive in the wild? \"So there's a fair bit we need to figure out first before we get to a point where we actually have genetically-modified stoats to deploy either in New Zealand or in Orkney,\" said Prof Gemmell.",

The proposed genetic technique known as a \"gene drive\" would involve altering the stoats' DNA to make them infertile. This would prevent them from reproducing and eventually lead to a decline in the population. For several years Professor Gemmell and his team have been working on the gene drive technology and think that it could be a game-changer in the fight against invasive species. \"We're not talking about entirely removing stoats but rather reducing their number to a level where they are no longer a threat to our native birds,\" he said. The idea has sparked interest in Orkney where conservationists are struggling to control the stoat population. The islands are home to several endangered bird species, including the hen harrier and the curlew, which are vulnerable to stoat attacks. Orkney Islands Council's environmental spokesperson, Councillor Steve Sankey, said: \"We are always looking for innovative solutions to protect our unique wildlife, and this gene drive technology is certainly an interesting idea. We'd be keen to learn more about it and to explore its potential for use in Orkney. But not everyone is convinced that gene drive is the answer. Some conservationists have raised concerns about the potential unintended consequences of tampering with the stoats DNA. \"We need to be careful about introducing genetically modified organisms into the wild,\" said Dr. Rachel Smirthwaite, a wildlife expert at the University of Edinburgh. \"We don't fully understand the long-term effects it could have on the ecosystem and there's a risk of unintended consequences. Professor Gemmell and his team continue to push with their research despite these concerns and they are hopeful that the gene-drive technology could be used to protect native bird populations in both New Zealand and Orkney. It is a complex issue but we believe that this technology has the potential to make a real difference,\" said Professor Gemmell. We're excited to continue our research and explore the possibilities of using gene drives to protect our unique and vulnerable wildlife.",

Mercedes eventually called him in to retire with five laps to go.The incident between the Mercedes drivers played into the hands of Red Bull, who had been expected to struggle on this track because of their Renault engine's power deficit to the Mercedes.The team tried to neutralise that by running a smaller rear wing than their rivals, relying on the car's standard-setting under-body downforce for grip.When Vettel ran wide at the fast Pouhon left-hander on lap five - his second driving error in as many races - Ricciardo swooped past to move into second and put the pressure on Rosberg.Rosberg made his first pit stop early, after just eight laps, because of the extra wear his loss of front downforce was causing his tyres and the time lost allowed Ricciardo into the lead.The Australian drove superbly to build a lead for himself and seemed set for a comfortable win before Rosberg's late stop, with 10 laps to go, raised the possibility of the German catching him.The stop dropped Rosberg to 20 seconds behind Ricciardo but he soon began closing at more than two seconds a lap. However, the Red Bull had enough to hold him off for his third victory of an increasingly impressive first season with a front-running team.Bottas drove a measured race to pass Raikkonen for third in the closing laps, as the Ferrari driver finally found some of the form he has been lacking all season.Raikkonen made ground with an early pit stop and ran in the top three most of the race before losing out to Bottas with eight laps to go.In the second Ferrari, Fernando Alonso found himself having to fight back after being forced to serve a five-second penalty at his first pit stop.That dropped him into a fight with the McLaren of Kevin Magnussen, who proved very difficult to pass as a result of the greater power of his Mercedes engine.Magnussen's delaying of Alonso brought Vettel and Button on to their tail, and the Ferrari lost out, its front wing damaged on the back of Vettel's car, in a no-holds-barred four-way fight in the closing laps.Alonso ended up eighth, behind Vettel, Magnussen and Button.Magnussen was later handed a 20-second penalty and two driver penalty points for crowding Alonso off the circuit during the battle, which promoted Force India's Nico Hulkenberg to 10th, behind team-mate Sergio Perez and Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat.Full race resultsBelgian Grand Prix coverage details",

Hull Trains and Heathrow Express shared top honors, with an impressive 97% of passengers expressing their satisfaction with their services. This is a testament to the hard work and dedication of these operators to provide a high-quality travel experience. On the other end of the spectrum, the southern rail, operated by Govia Thameslink, had the lowest customer satisfaction rating at 72%. However, it's worth noting that this still represents a 3% increase from 2016, indicating that efforts to improve services are bearing fruit.The survey's findings will likely be welcomed by the rail industry, which has faced criticism in recent years over issues such as delays, cancellations and overcrowding. The results suggest that efforts are paying off to address these concerns and that passengers are beginning to see tangible improvements in their travel experience.

Libs Gen Mayall's comments on Russia's intervention in Syria are also significant, as they suggest that some senior military officers may be re-evaluating their approach The general admission that the Russians were \"in many ways more realistic about the staying power of Assad\" is a rare acknowledgement of the effectiveness of Russia's strategy in Syria. The Russian intervention, which began in September 2015, has been widely criticized by the West, with many arguing that it has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in Syria and propped up a brutal regime. However, the comments of Lt Gen Mayall suggest that some in the military community may be a more nuanced view of Russia's actions, recognizing that they have helped to stabilize the Assad regime and prevent the collapse of the Syrian state. The general's remarks are likely to spark a lively debate about the UK approach to the Middle East and the role Russia is playing in the region. As the conflict in Syria continues to rage on, it is clear that the UK and its allies need to rethink their strategy and find a way to bring a lasting peace to the region. In related news, the UK government announced that it would increase its humanitarian aid to Syria, with an additional £40 million pledged to support refugees and displaced persons.",

Belgium's Luca Brecel completed the quarter-final and defeated Stephen Maguire 6-3. Marks is one of the most consistent players on the tour this season. Brecel will face either Neil Robertson or Stuart Bingham in the last eight. The success of Williams means Wales have two quarter-finalists in the British Championship for the first time since 2001, when he and Matthew Stevens reached the last eight. Williams, who has been struggling in recent years with his form, showed remarkable resilience and determination to come from behind and win the match. Highfield, who has been in good form this season, is disappointed to have let the match slip away, but he can take heart from a brave performance. The quarter-finals begin on Friday, with Williams face O'Sullivan in the final match of the day.

However, only 9% of infants who were not ill developed asthma.How the virus might be able to do this was, however, unknown. Now a team of researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine believe they have an explanation.Their experiments on mice showed the virus impaired the ability of a specific part of the immune system, called regulatory T cells, to calm inflammation.Inflammation is an important part of dealing with an infection. However, for asthma patients, chemicals in air which come from ordinary things like dust mites, pets and mould can trigger an inappropriate inflammatory response.Infection with RSV led to a \"complete loss of suppressive function\" of the regulatory T cells, after which the mice developed asthma-like symptoms,\" researchers Prof Anuradha Ray and Prof Prabir Ray told the BBC.They said there might be a window in early life when the cells were vulnerable to being \"crippled\".They think the finding could help scientists devise treatments which prevent some people developing asthma. \"We feel that both prophylactic and therapeutic approaches can be developed. \"This is especially desirable in infants who have a strong family history of asthma. \"Malayka Rahman, from Asthma UK, said: \"This research provides vital information on how viruses interact with our immune cells and why this might lead to an increased risk of asthma. \"What's really exciting is the potential of these findings to translate into new treatments for asthma in the future.\"",

The study suggests that this could be a key factor in the development of asthma in early childhood. Danuta Radzioch, the lead author of the study, said: \"Our research shows that RSV infection can have a long-lasting impact on the immune system, making it more likely for children to develop asthma. This is a significant breakthrough in our understanding of the condition and could lead to the development of new drugs to prevent asthma. Erika Kennington of asthma UK welcomed the findings, saying: \"This study has really exciting potential for the future of asthma research. If we can understand how the RSV infection contributes to the development of asthma, we can possibly develop new ways to prevent the disease in the first place. Researchers are now planning further studies to explore how the RSV infection affects the immune system and to identify potential targets for new treatments. In the meantime, the study suggests the importance of taking steps to prevent RSV infection in young children, such as washing hands regularly, avoiding close contact with anyone who has a cold or other respiratory infection, and cleaning surfaces. With asthma affecting over 5 million people in the UK alone, this research brings new hope for a future where the condition can be prevented or better managed.",

Despite Knight's decision, the team remains confident of its chances of success and will look to build on their recent successes under the leadership of captain Heather Knight. Knight said in a statement : \"This was not an easy decision for me to make, but I feel it is in the best interest of the team. I am committed to continuing to play my part in the team's success and I am excited to see the team continue to grow and develop in the coming months and years. Heather Knight's decision to step down as vice-captain of the England women's cricket team has sent shockwaves through cricketing world, with many of her teammates and opponents taking to social media to express their surprise and admiration for her leadership skills. Former England captain Charlotte Edwards tweeted: Her decision to step down as vice-captain is a huge surprise, but I have no doubt she'll continue to be a key player for England. Respect to her for putting the team first. \"Australian all-rounder Ellyse Perry took to Twitter to praise Knight’s leadership and wrote: “Heather Knight is one of the most respected players in the women’s game.",

There is a limited amount of drugs they can use, so there shouldn't be a massive difference in price - not to the levels we're seeing in our data. \"Ms Seenan said CCGs often did not know how much they should be paying for treatment. \"Some appear to take the price they're given or don't question what is included in the cycle,\" she said.Prof Nargund and Ms Seenan suggested CCGs should work together to improve their commissioning process and create economies of scale.The Department of Health has not yet responded to our request for comment.The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:15-11:00 BST on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.",

The call for a national price comes as the NHS faces increasing pressure to reduce costs and make efficiency gains. Prof Nargund argues however that a standardized pricing system would ultimately save NHS money long-term. \"By reducing the variation in the pricing, we can reduce the administrative burden on CCGs and clinics and ensure that the resources are more effectively used,\" she said. Fertility Fairness, the campaign group that provided the data on CCG pricing, welcomed Prof Nargund's call for a national tariff. Susan Seenan, the chair of the group, said: \"We have long argued that the current system is unfair and inefficient. A national tariff would help to ensure that everyone has access to the same level of care, no matter where they live. The health department has said it will consider Prof Nargund's proposal as part of its ongoing review of fertility services.

The report also criticizes the lack of communication between hospital staff and social care services, which often resulted in patients obtaining essential support or care.

Teachers and headteachers have been warning about the devastating impact of funding cuts which, according to them, lead to a larger class size, reduced resources and a narrowing of the curriculum. According to the National Union of Teachers (NUT), the average primary school has lost £52,000 from its budget since 2015, while the average secondary school lost £178,000. The union claims that these cuts are having a disproportionate impact on schools in disadvantaged areas, who are already struggling to provide a decent education to their students. The department of education has disputed the union's claims saying that school funding is at a record high. However, teachers and parents argue that this figure does not take into account the rising costs of things like national insurance, pension contributions and the apprenticeship levy, which are eating into school budgets. Jo Yurky, founder of the parents' campaign group Fair Funding For All Schools, said that the situation was \"desperate\" and that parents were \"at their own end\" trying to support their local schools. \"We're seeing schools have to make difficult choices between heating and staffing, between books and buildings,\" she said. It's a scandal that our children are being forced to suffer because of the government's refusal to properly fund our schools. The NUT's decision to consider strikes was welcomed by other teaching unions which have also been campaigning against the cutbacks in funding. The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said that it would support any action that was “proportionate and reasonable” in response to the funding crisis.As the dispute over school funding continues to escalate, it remains to be seen whether the government will respond to the concerns of teachers, parents and pupils.",

This year, 160 officers will be recruited and the force had been \"inundated\" with applications, he said.But, with more money needed to be saved by 2020, Mr Farrar said police needed to work in different ways to ensure they were as efficient and effective as possible.He said detective work was benefitting from computers. Surveillance work that involves physically following a suspect might take a week - but the same checks can now often be carried out online because people post so much on social media, he said. \"The reality is a lot of the job we do, if it doesn't contain emotion then we can probably do it by way of a computer. \"So a lot of the things that we may be able to do in the future though artificial intelligence might be things that ordinarily would have been done by people. \"Mr Farrar pointed out the usefulness of drones in the case of the body of a woman murdered 20 years ago being found at Wentwood Reservoir, near Newport. \"We couldn't have done that by foot and conventional means,\" said Mr Farrar, speaking as Gwent Police celebrated its 50th anniversary. \"We put a drone up in the air, the drone was right above the scene and I had in my office perfect HD quality pictures of the scene. We could never have done that [without the drone]. \"I actually think in years to come, and it's not that far off, we will have one of those drones in the back of every police vehicle so we will be able to deploy those all the time. \"Earlier this year, Gwent became the second force in Wales after South Wales Police to gain permission from the Civil Aviation Authority to use the drones - or unmanned aircrafts - to help search for missing people, tackle anti-social behaviour and other operations.In addition, police officers now have body cams to record incidents and hand-held devices which can quickly carry out checks on vehicles and criminal records.Back at police headquarters in Cwmbran, Mr Farrar has an app he can use to look at any officer's pocket book in real time if he needs any information.But, ultimately, he said computers would never fully replace the role of police officers. \"The public still like to see a police officer as it's reassuring.\"",

His comments come at a time when Gwent Police are facing significant budget constraints. The force has already been hit with £50 million of budget cuts and needs an additional £9 million in savings. Farrar remains optimistic about the potential of technology to improve and reduce police costs despite these challenges. \"I think we'll see more and more computers doing jobs that don't involve emotion,\" Farrar said. The drones are used to support officers, and we will see more automation in the way we do things. The idea of drones patrolling the skies may seem like science fiction, but it is already a reality in some parts of the world. For example, in the United States, police departments use drones to respond to emergency calls, survey crime scenes and even track suspects. Falr's vision for a drone-filled future is not just about gadgets and gadgets, but about finding ways to make police better and more efficient. With budget cuts looming, the police force needs to find ways to do more with less. We will have to be more innovative and creative in how we do things, said Farrar. \"We can't just keep doing things the way we've always done them and expect different results. While the use of drones and automation may lead to some cost savings, it is unclear how these technologies will be funded in the short term. The police force is still grappling with the impact of 50 million pounds in funding cuts and it's unclear where the money will come from to invest in new technology. Despite these challenges, Farrar remains committed to his vision for a more technologically advanced police force. \"I think we can make a real difference in the way we guard our communities\", he said. \"We just have to be brave enough to take the leap.\" Farrar’s enthusiasm for technology is not limited to drones. He also sees a future where Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a key role in police trafficking. AI can help us analyze data, identify patterns and make predictions,'' he said. \"It can help us prioritize our resources and make more informed decisions. \"One area where AI could have a significant impact is the analysis of CCTV footage. Currently, police spend countless hours reviewing footage to identify suspects and collect evidence. This process could be automated with AI, freeing officers up to focus on more critical tasks.Farrar believes also that technology can help improve community engagement and trust.",

The crash was a dramatic turn of events in what had to be a relatively calm stage until that point. The riders had been content to let a breakaway group of four riders gain a small advantage, but as they approached the final 20 kilometers, the pace began to pick up and the peloton tipped against the wall when the stationary police motorcyclist suddenly appeared in the road, creating a ripple effect through the peloton. Thomas, who had been riding near the front of the group, was unable to avoid the crash and went down, along with several other riders. Despite the setback, Thomas was able to remount and continue to ride, but the damage had already been done. Now he faces an uphill battle to recover the time he had lost and to go back into contention for the overall victory.Quintana, on the other hand, was thrilled with his good fortune and he said in a post-performance interview : \"I saw an opportunity and I took it.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that the death toll from the conflict has risen to over 100,000, with more than 2 million people internally displaced and over 4 million refugees fleeing neighboring countries. The conflict in Syria began in March 2011 as a popular uprising against President Assad’s regime, and has escalated to a full-scale civil war, with multiple factions and extremist groups involved. The situation remains volatile, with no end to the violence and suffering of the Syrian people in sight. The UN Under-Secretary-General's plea for humanitarian access comes as the international community is increasingly concerned about the dire situation in Syria. The country's health system has been severely damaged, with many hospitals and medical facilities destroyed or forced to close due to the conflict. \"The lack of access to medical care is having a devastating impact on the Syrian people,\" said Dr. Ahmed, a Syrian doctor who works with a humanitarian organization in the country. It is seen that cases of treatable illnesses and injuries go untreated, leading to unneeded suffering and death. The situation is particularly dire for children who are the primary victims of the conflict. According to UNICEF, more than 5 million children are in need of humanitarian assistance, with many forced to flee their homes and live in makeshift camps or shelters. The psychological trauma these children are experiencing is immense,\" said Dr. Maria, a child psychologist who has worked with Syrian refugees in Jordan. They have witnessed unimaginable violence and have been forced to flee their homes, leaving everything they know and love behind. It is a tragedy of epic proportions. \"The international community has been criticized for inaction in the Syrian crisis. Despite numerous resolutions and statements condemning violence, little has been done to stop the bloodshed. \"The international community has failed the Syrian people,\" said Ammar, a Syrian activist who had been campaigning for an end to the conflict.",

Despite initial concerns about the portal's safety, officials have reported no adverse impacts on the surrounding environment or population. In fact, many people who approached the portal have reported feeling a strange, euphoric sensation, which has led to some speculating about its potential benefits. \"We've had people coming from all over the city, even from other states, to experience the portal for themselves,\" said LAPD officer James Johnson, who has been stationed at the site since its appearance. It is a real challenge to keep the crowds under control, but so far everything has remained peaceful. As researchers continue to study the portal, theories about its origins are rampant. Some believe it could be a natural phenomenon similar to the aurora borealis, while others think it might be the result of some sort of advanced technology. But one thing is certain: the portal has brought the city together in a way that few other events have.

The relationship with ITV went badly wrong for a while. Woodward gambled on refusing to take expensive ITV drama, and had to admit defeat.The demise of police drama Taggart as a money-earner has yet to be replaced. The drive towards becoming an independent producer for other channels has been bumpy and fallen short of expectations.But STV has survived, and is in fairly robust health - the only part of the channel 3 network that is independent of ITV.It has refocused on its online news and entertainment, learning quickly that the plan to go hyper-local with hundreds of parish pump news sites was not going to work, and changing tack.Its video-on-demand is growing by 23% in the first five months of this year.Scotland Tonight has been a notable success, seeing off its BBC rival in the same time slot.And Woodward has taken the opportunity of new licences for local TV, deftly turning them from city stations into a new national network, and beating the BBC to an integrated TV news programme.STV2, launched on Monday, may not be quite the spirit intended when the licences were handed out. It may not have much of a budget. But so far, it's been proving a smarter business than others who won the right to give local TV a try.Ten years is often seen as an appropriate time for a chief executive to move on, for reasons of good governance.But one other reason why Mr Woodward may be thinking of getting out of his Clydeside office is the appearance among his shareholders of an investment fund called Crystal Amber.It has just raised its stake to 14% of STV shares. That's in addition to 21% of shares in Johnston Press.Why? Richard Bernstein, who runs the fund from London and Guernsey, isn't saying. But Crystal Amber is an activist investor.As Ashley Highfield is finding at Johnston Press in Edinburgh, its interest in a stock may help support the price, but it can also be a warning of turbulence ahead.",

This remarkable turnaround is a testament to Woodward's strategic vision and the ability to inspire and motivate his team.

They will do it for a few days, but they won't continually stick at it. \"A lot of farmers are not going to plant next year's crops if they are concerned they are not going [have the workers to] harvest them. It's a huge conundrum. \"A Home Office spokesman said there were no plans to bring in a new scheme to allow nationals from non-EU countries such as Ukraine, Russia and Turkey to work on UK farms during peak harvest seasons.Faster tractors? \"The horticultural industry should be able to meet demand for temporary season workers by recruiting within the UK and the rest of the EU,\" he said. \"\"The government does not intend to open a new seasonal workers scheme. \"Mr Raymond said a new scheme would benefit foreign countries because visiting students could take skills back to their homeland.The plea for a \"reliable source of migrant labour to the UK horticulture sector\" is among a number of demands made by the NFU - which represents 55,000 farmers across England and Wales - in its 2015 manifesto.It also calls for increased speed limits for tractors on public roads, and for the next government to negotiate with the EU to reduce environmental restrictions imposed on farmers as part of the Common Agricultural Policy.It urges promotion of the Britain is Great campaign for British produce to open up export markets, and insists \"urgent action must be taken\" to tackle bovine TB to stop it spreading into new regions and becoming endemic nationwide.Farmers also want an accelerated rollout of high-speed broadband to all rural areas and to emphasise that \"environment and climate change policy needs to go hand in hand with growth in production\".",

Without access to temporary foreign workers, Raymond warns that farmers will be forced to reduce their plantings, resulting in reduced yields and possible shortages of fresh produce. \"We are not talking about a few extra apples or apples here,\" he emphasized. \"We are talking about a significant reduction in the quantity of food available to British consumers. The NFU is calling on the government to restore a temporary visa program for farmers originating outside the EU, similar to the seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme that was closed last year. The scheme allowed workers from Bulgaria and Romania to work in the UK for up to six months at a time, providing a vital source of labour for farmers during peak harvest seasons. Raymond argues that the closure of the scheme has left a significant gap in the labor market which can not be filled alone by British workers. \"We've tried to recruit British workers, but the reality is that many are not willing to get up at 6:00 am to start harvesting,\" he said. We need a temporary solution to meet the demand for labor during peak seasons. The NFU's warning comes as the UK agriculture industry faces increasing pressure to meet growing demand for fresh products. With the population projected to reach 70 million by 2025, the need for a reliable and efficient food supply chain has never been more pressing. In response to the NFU's concerns, a government spokesperson said that the ministers are committed to supporting British farmers and ensuring a stable food supply. However, the spokesperson stopped short of committing to re-create the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme, citing the need for a \"more sustainable and long-term solution\" to the labor shortage. One thing is clear as the debate continues over foreign labor and food security and the consequences of inaction could be severe. Will the government heed the warning of the NFU and take steps to address the labor shortage, or will British consumers be forced to confront the reality of food shortages and higher prices? The time will only tell.",

If they break up red blood cells or white blood cells or damage proteins then there is a cost of that. \"The pump is commonly known as a ventricular assist device (VAD) and the one being developed in Swansea is called a MiniVAD.After being implanted directly into the heart, it is driven by an embedded electric motor and powered by a battery pack worn by the user.Mr McConchie said the device was designed to \"assist the heart itself and not to replace it\".The last VAD produced was sold to one of the world's major cardiovascular companies for $3.4bn (about Â£2.6bn), he added.But while there is a huge monetary value to the product, Mr McConchie said the key aspect is that it will improve a patient's quality of life. \"If we can demonstrate that we have reduced the adverse events, you have something that's much more forgettable that's put inside the body,\" he added. \"Patients don't have to go back into hospital for correction of any adverse events, so the absolute cost benefit becomes substantial. \"That means the NHS, for example, or a healthcare provider in other countries like the United States, don't have as much cost in treating the patient who has a ventricle assist device and the benefit to society comes with that. \"Mr McConchie said the patient experience was \"much, much better\" if they do not have to visit the hospital frequently.",

According to Calon Cardio, the device is also equipped with advanced sensors and software that enable real-time monitoring and optimization of its performance. Heart failure is a major public health concern, affecting an estimated 26 million people worldwide. Current treatment options, including medication and lifestyle changes, often provide limited relief and heart transplants are only available to a select few. The development of this new pump offers a promising alternative with the potential to significantly improve the quality of life of patients with heart failure. Clinical trials, due later this year, will involve a small group of patients with advanced heart failure. If successful, the trials will pave the way for a larger, more comprehensive study with the aim of securing regulatory approval and making the device available by 2020. The development of Steve Conlan, a leading cardiologist at Swansea University, has been hailed as a \"major breakthrough\" in the field of cardiovascular medicine. \"This innovative pump has the potential to transform the treatment of heart failure, offering new hope to patients and their families,\" said Dr. Conlan. \"We are excited to be involved in the clinical trials and look forward to seeing the positive effect this device will have on people's lives.\" The development of the miniaturized pump is the result of a collaborative effort between Calon Cardio and Swansea University with support from the Welsh government and the British Heart Foundation. The project has brought together a team of experts in cardiovascular medicine, engineering and computer science to develop a device that addresses the complex needs of heart failure patients. According to McConchie, the pump's compact design and advanced sensors make it an ideal solution for patients who require continuous support. \"Our device is designed to be worn externally, allowing patients to move freely and live a more normal life,\" explained he.",

The report also highlighted the impact of this segregation on local communities, with older areas often lacking the vitality and energy that younger people bring. In response to the report a government spokeswoman said, \"We recognize the importance of building more homes to address the housing shortage and ensure that communities are mixed and vibrant. Housebuilding is an absolute priority for this government and we are committed to deliver 300,000 new homes a year by the mid 2020s. \"However, critics argue that government focus may not be enough to address the root causes of age segregation. \"We have to think about the type of housing we are building, not just the quantity,\" said Hanton.

His second wife, Leila Trabelsi, played a prominent role in Tunisian public life and reportedly helped amass huge economic holdings for her extended family.With no obvious rivals to Ben Ali, there was speculation that he was looking to pass on power to one of his relatives.In the final days of 2010, a series of protests began in the centre of the country after a young graduate set himself on fire when stopped from selling fruit and vegetables without a licence.The protests, advertised widely through social media networks, gradually spread.Ben Ali initially blamed the demonstrations on a fringe of \"extremists\". But he changed tack on 13 January, expressing deep regrets for the deaths of protesters, pledging to introduce media freedoms, and promising not to stand in 2014.But his offer of concessions failed to quell the unrest, and the following day, after huge crowds took to the streets of Tunis and clashed with the security forces once again, he fled the country.",

        "text": "During his early years in office, he implemented a series of economic reforms that attracted foreign investment and led to rapid economic growth. He also took steps to improve the country's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges and airports. However, as the time went on, Ben Ali's regime became increasingly authoritarian. He cracked down on political dissent, restricting the freedom of speech and assembly and is imprisoning opposition leaders and human rights activists. His government was also accused of corruption and nepotism, with Ben Ali and his family members using their power to enrich themselves. Ben Ali remained in power for over two decades, winning election after election with landslide victories. However, his regime was eventually toppled in 2011 following a wave of protests that swept across the Middle East and North Africa, known as the Arab Spring. The demonstrations in Tunisia, which began in December 2010, were sparked by the self-immolation of a young street vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi who was frustrated by the lack of economic opportunities and the corruption of the Ben Ali regime. The protests quickly gained momentum, with thousands of Tunisians taking to the streets to demand democratic reforms and an end to Ben Ali's rule. Ben Ali fled Tunisia on January 14th 2011, leaving behind a power vacuum which was eventually filled by an interim government. The country then held its first free and fair elections which led to the establishment of a new democratic government. Ben Ali and his wife Leila Trabelsi were later convicted of embezzling and misuse of public funds and sentenced to 35 years in prison. They are currently living in exile in Saudi Arabia, where they were granted asylum after fleeing Tunisia. Ben Ali's legacy continues to shape Tunisia's politics. The country is still grappling with the challenges of building a stable democracy and many Tunisians remain frustrated by the slow pace of economic growth and the persistence of corruption. However, the Arab Spring protests, which began in Tunisia, have inspired a new generation of activists and politicians who are committed to building a more just and equitable society.",

Many of these soldiers are of Commonwealth countries rather than from the UK itself. General Carter acknowledged that the army shares values such as loyalty, respect and selfless commitment with those of minority communities. He emphasized that the Army needed to do more to reach out to these communities and showcase the opportunities and benefits a career in the military can offer. The Army has launched several initiatives aimed at increasing diversity and inclusion, including targeted recruitment campaigns and outreach programs. However, General Carter acknowledged that more needs to be done to address the underlying barriers that may prevent talented individuals from minority backgrounds from joining the Army. \"We have to understand what the obstacles are and we need to address them,\" he said. We need to make sure that we are an attractive employer and that we are seen for people from all backgrounds as an employer of choice. \"The Army's efforts to increase diversity and inclusion are not only important for reflecting the society it serves, but also for maintaining its operational effectiveness. A more diverse Army, argued General Carter, would bring a wider range of perspectives and skills to the table, ultimately making it a more effective and adaptable force. General Carter's comments come as the Army faces increasing pressure to improve its diversity and inclusion record. A recent report by the Ministry of Defense found that the Army had made some progress but that more must be done to address the cultural and structural barriers that prevent minority groups from joining and progressing within the military. One of the key challenges the Army faces is changing its image and perception among minority communities.",

He said: \"Despite our intentions, many consider the pictures of our unfortunate kind offending \". We understand that the series has caused harm and for this, we are truly sorry.

The new guidelines emphasize also the importance of spreading drinking on three to four days, rather than consuming large amounts in a session. This is aimed at reducing the risk of drinking a high alcohol, which can lead to accidents, injuries and violent behavior.In addition, the guidelines advise that women who are pregnant or try to conceive should avoid drinking altogether, as even small quantities of alcohol can increase the risk of a miscarriage, stillbirth or fetal alcohol syndrome.The chief medical officers of the UK also emphasised the importance of individual circumstances such as age, gender, and medical history when assessing the risks associated with drinking. For example, older adults may be more susceptible to the negative effects of alcohol due to age-related changes in the body. The revised guidelines have been welcomed by health activists who have long argued that the previous guidelines were too lenient. \"These new guidelines are a step in the right direction,\" said Katherine Brown, the director of the Institute for Alcohol Studies. \"They reflect the latest scientific evidence and provide clear and consistent advice to help people make informed decisions about their drinking habits.

A spokesperson for the Scottish government criticized the report, arguing that it presented a \"one-sided\" view of trade, by only considering the demand for Scottish exports, while ignoring the importance of imports from the rest of the UK and EU. \"Trade is a two-way process, and this report fails to take into account the many jobs in Scotland that rely on imports from the rest of the UK and the EU, said the spokesperson. \"We need a more comprehensive understanding of the trade links of Scotland, rather than cherry-picking statistics to support a particular narrative. In response, a spokesperson of the UK Government defended the report, saying it provided a \"valuable insight\" into the importance of trade with the rest of the UK for the economy of Scotland. \"The fact that over 500,000 jobs are linked to trade with the rest of the UK is a testament to the strength of our internal market,\" the spokesperson said. The findings of the report are likely to fuel the ongoing debate over Scotland's economic future, especially in context of the UK decision to leave the EU. Supporters of Scottish independence have long argued that Scotland's economy would be better served by having control over its own trade policies, while opponents argue that the country benefits from being part of the wider economy of the UK. The report of the Allander Institute is expected to be closely scrutinized by policymakers and economists in the coming weeks, as Scotland's economic future remains a subject of intense debate. The report’s findings also sparked a renewed call for more clarity on the post-Brexit trade plans of the UK government with many in Scotland's business community expressing concern over the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on the country’s economy. \"Scotland's business need certainty and stability to thrive, and the lack of clear guidance on the trade plans in the UK is creating real anxiety,\" said Tracy Black, Director of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) in Scotland. The UK government is calling for more detail on their trade negotiations and to work closely with the Scottish government to ensure that Scotland's unique economic needs are taken into account. The Scottish National Party (SNP), which long advocated for Scottish independence, has seized upon the report's findings as evidence that Scotland's economy would be better served by having control over its own trade policies. \"This report highlights the importance of trade to Scotland's economy but it also emphasizes the need for Scotland to have a seat at the table in international trade negotiations,\" said Keith Brown, SNP's economic spokesperson.",

It is a massive disruption to their lives. According to data obtained by BBC Cymru, 16 children in the Swansea council area are currently living outside of Wales while none are from Carmarthenshire and Denbighshire in this situation. The figures vary widely between authorities, with some councils having no children placed outside Wales, while others have multiple cases. Action for Children, a charity that works with vulnerable children and young people, has expressed concern about the impact of placements out of the area on children's well-being. \"It's not just about distance, it's about the sense of disconnection and isolation that these children can feel,\" said Ms. Welham. The charity is calling for more foster carer who come forward, especially in areas where there is a shortage of placements. \"We need more people to consider becoming foster carers so that we can provide stable and loving homes for these children,\" said Ms. Welham. The Welsh government has also responded to the issue and stated that it is working to increase the number of foster carers in Wales and improve support for children in care. \"We understand the importance of ensuring stable and nurturing environments for children in care, and we are committed to ensuring that they receive the support they need to thrive,\" said a spokesperson. However, critics argue that more needs to be done to address the root causes of the problem. \"We need to look at why these children end up in care in the first place, and what we can do to help families stay together,\" said a social worker. As the debate continues, one thing is clear: the issue of out-of-area placements is complex and multifaceted and it will require a concerted effort from all parties involved to find a solution that puts the needs of children first.",

Theo Walcott scored twice in the first half to give Arsenal a comfortable lead. His first goal came in the 15th minute, when he buried on a through ball from Mesut Ozil and slotted past Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. Just before halftime, Walcott doubled his tally, capitalizing on a defensive error to score his fifth goal of the season, however Swansea refused to give up and pulled out a goal back in the 52nd minute through Gylfi Sigurdsson's stunning free kick. The Icelandic midfielder curled the ball over the wall and into the top corner leaving Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech with no chance. The game took a dramatic turn in the 70th minute when Xhaka was shown a straight red card for a reckless challenge on Swansea's Modou Barrow. The Swiss midfielder's sack gave Swansea a numerical advantage, and they quickly capitalized on it. Borja Baston scored his first goal for the club in the 74th minute and hit a cross from Sigurdsson to level the scores at 2-2 but Arsenal refused to buckle under pressure and Ozil scored the winner in the 84th minute. The German playedmaker collected a pass from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and cut a shot at the bottom corner, scoring all three points for the Gunners.

He had played youth football.According to a family member, Martin studied aviation through a part-time school programme, hoping to fly or become an engineer.In the week before his death he was on suspension from school for reportedly possessing a plastic bag with traces of marijuana. His father, Tracy Martin, told USA Today he hoped a short stay in Sanford, Florida, would teach his son a lesson.Martin also tweeted, changing his username at least once and writing thousands of tweets about his high school, sex and his favourite snacks.Friends and teachers at Michael D Krop Senior High described him as a \"funny guy\" and \"very creative\".Without ID on him at the time of the shooting, Martin was labelled as a \"John Doe\" by Sanford police and at the morgue until his father reported him missing.George Zimmerman, 29, the son of a white father and Hispanic mother, was born in Virginia and moved to Sanford in 2009 with his wife.Mr Zimmerman had asked a neighbour in Virginia for a recommendation letter to a police academy programme, but never applied.Records show he had previously worked at a car dealership and sold insurance, but what he was doing at the time of the shooting is unclear. A defence witness has said Mr Zimmerman was in the process of starting a business.He also attended a citizen's police academy with the Seminole Sheriff's Office.A spokeswoman described the once-a-week scheme that totalled 14 hours as an educational tool to teach residents about police work, not a training programme.In 2005, Mr Zimmerman was arrested for shoving a state alcohol agency officer near a bar.The charge was later dropped when he agreed to fulfil a \"pre-trial diversion\" programme for first-time offenders, which usually involves fines and anger management classes.Shortly after, a girlfriend took out a restraining order, following an argument where each accused the other of being the aggressor.Mr Zimmerman possessed a concealed-carry permit for a 9mm handgun.As a neighbourhood watch volunteer, he had called Sanford's police department 46 times over the previous eight years. A friend told the court he had taught Mr Zimmerman firearm safety.According to neighbours, Mr Zimmerman organised the neighbourhood watch during a rash of burglaries in the community.One neighbour said the 29-year-old had caught a thief while patrolling the neighbourhood.",

Zimmerman, a 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer, was patrolling the streets in his SUV on the lookout for suspicious activity. As Martin walked through the gated community, Zimmerman spotted him and immediately became suspicious. He called the police to report a \"suspicious person\" in the area, describing Martin as a black male wearing a hoodie. Despite being told by the dispatcher to stay in his vehicle and not to approach the person, Zimmerman got out of his car and began to follow Martin on foot. Then it is known that Zimmerman and Martin had a physical altercation that ended with Zimmerman shooting Martin in the chest. Shortly afterwards, Martin died and Zimmerman was left standing claiming self-defense.The incident sparked widespread outrage and protests across the country, with many calling for Zimmerman's arrest and prosecution. The case drew national attention with civil rights leaders and celebrities weighing in on the matter. The #JusticeForTrayvon hashtag appeared on social media and rallies were held in cities across the United States. In the aftermath of the shooting, Zimmerman was eventually arrested and charged with second-degree murder. His trial was highly publicized, with many people closely following the proceedings. In July 2013 a jury delivered a verdict which would shock the nation: Zimmerman was not guilty of murder, sparking widespread protests and outrage. The acquittal of Zimmerman was met with disbelief and anger from many who felt that justice had not been served. The case highlighted the issue of racial profiling, police brutality and systemic racism, sparking a national conversation about the value of black lives in America. The pain of losing one would never subside for Trayvon Martin's family. His mother, Sybrina Fulton, would later become a vocal advocate for gun control and racial justice, using her son's death as catalyst for change. For George Zimmerman, his life would never be the same, as he struggled to come to terms with the consequences of his actions. The Trayvon Martin case would become a defining moment in American history, a painful reminder of the deep issues that continue to plague our society. It would also serve as catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement, which would then become a powerful force for change in the years to come.",

This is a positive sign as it indicates that the bank is able to charge borrowers a higher interest rate on their loans while paying savers a lower interest rate on their deposits. Despite these improvements, the bank still faces significant challenges. Its common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, a key measure of a bank's financial strength, remains below the minimum regulation of 9.3%. The bank has set a target of reaching a CET1 ratio of 10% by the end of the year but achieving this requires further reductions in cost and improvements in profitability. The bank's chief executive, Andrew Bester, acknowledged the ongoing challenges but expressed optimism about progress in the bank. \"We are making good progress in reducing our expenses and improving our capital position,\" said he. \"While we still have work to do, we're confident we are on the right path. The Co-op Bank results come at a time of growing competition in the banking sector, with new challenger banks and Fintech companies competing for market share. The bank's ability to adapt to this changing landscape will be crucial to its long-term success.The bank's board announced plans to launch a new digital banking platform aimed at attracting younger customers and improving the overall customer experience. The platform is expected to launch later this year and will offer a range of new features and services including mobile payments and real-time account updates. The results of the Co-op Bank will be closely watched by investors and regulators who will look for signs of sustained improvement in the bank's financial performance. With the bank's capital position strengthening and costs down, there are reasons to be optimistic about its prospects.",

Hundreds of protesters milled around the police department in Ferguson, following the news on radios and mobile phones.Explaining the decision, Mr McCulloch said the jury's job had been to separate fact from fiction, and that some witness statements had been contradicted by physical evidence. \"These grand jurors poured their hearts and soul into this process,\" he said.Protesters have been chanting, \"Hands up, don't shoot\" - a reference to statements by some witnesses who said Mr Brown had had his hands up in apparent surrender to the officer when he was shot.Police say there was a struggle between the teenager and the officer before the shooting.In his own testimony, Mr Wilson says that before the shooting Mr Brown pushed him back into his car, hit him and briefly grabbed his drawn gun.The jury was made up of 12 randomly picked citizens - nine white and three black.At least nine votes were needed in order to issue an indictment.Mr McCulloch said the biggest challenge for his office was the \"24-hour news cycle and an insatiable appetite for something - for anything - to talk about\".After the announcement, Mr Brown's family issued a statement saying they were \"profoundly disappointed that the killer of our child will not face the consequence of his actions\".Outside the police department, Mr Brown's mother burst into tears.Some in the crowd began throwing objects at a police line.Shortly afterwards shots were fired, and protesters were seen vandalising police cars, at least one of which was set on fire. Police responded with smoke and tear gas.Firefighters tackled a large blaze and heavy black smoke at a retail building, with reports of a pharmacy and a pizza shop also on fire.Several other buildings were broken into and looted.The Federal Aviation Authority said it was restricting the path of some flights into St Louis amid the unrest.Thousands of people also protested in other US cities including Los Angeles, Philadelphia and New York.

Police responding with tear gas and rubber bullets responded attempting to disperse the crowds. At least 29 people were arrested and several officers were injured in the clashes. The violence was not limited to Ferguson, as protests and demonstrations erupted in cities across the country, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Many of the protests were peaceful, with marchers holding signs and chanting slogans, but some turned violent, with reports of vandalism and clashes with the police. The Brown family, who had been calling for justice and accountability in the wake of Michael's death, released a statement expressing their disappointment and frustration with the decision of the grand jury. \"We are profoundly disappointed that the killer of our child will not face the consequences of his actions\", read the statement. \"We will continue to fight for justice and to ensure that Michael's death is not in vain. The shooting of Michael Brown in the United States has sparked a national conversation about race, police brutality and systemic inequality. The officer, who has been on administrative leave since the shooting, released through his lawyers a statement saying that he was \"grateful\" for the decision of the grand jury and that he had acted in self-defense in the process. Many have called for reforms in the criminal justice system, including the use of body cameras by police officers and greater diversity in the police departments. The FBI has launched a separate investigation into the shooting and the Department of Justice is conducting a civil rights investigation into the Ferguson Police Department. As protests and demonstrations continue, many are left wondering what the future holds for Ferguson and for the country as a whole. Will the decision of the Grand Jury spark meaningful change or will it lead to further division and unrest? The time will only tell. As the protests and demonstrations continue to unfold, the nation is in high alert, with many calling for calm and others demanding justice. The White House has issued a statement urging peaceful protests and promising to continue to work towards reform, while civil rights leaders and activists are planning a series of rallies and marches in the coming days. Ferguson community is still reeling from the Grand Jury decision, with many residents feeling a sense of betrayal and frustration. \"This is not justice,\" said one protester who wished to remain anonymous. \"This is just another example of how our system fails us repeatedly and again. In Ferguson, however, there are also signs of hope and resilience despite the violence and unrest.",

The United States, Japan and South Korea were particularly vocal in their criticism, with US Ambassador Samantha Power calling the launch \"a reckless and destabilizing act. The decision of the council to adopt a new sanctions resolution comes as a response to North Korea's continued defiance of international law. The resolution is expected to include harsher penalties and stricter measures to curb North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The launch of Sunday was widely seen as a provocation, with many experts believing that the rocket was actually a test of a ballistic missile capable of reaching the United States. The rocket was detected by US and South Korean military officials who tracked the trajectory of the rocket and confirmed that it had reached orbit.North Korea's actions in the region have caused widespread concern with Japan and South Korea placing their militaries on high alert. The launch has also raised tensions between North Korea and the United States, with the White House calling the act \"a serious threat to regional and international security\" The international community is now waiting to see how North Korea will respond to the council's condemnation and the imminent sanctions. As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: Pyongyang has a long history of ignoring international pressure and continuing to pursue nuclear and missile programs, despite the economic and diplomatic costs. The stakes have never been higher. The United Nations Security Council's swift and unanimous condemnation of North Korea's latest rocket launch sent a strong message to Pyongyang: the international community will not tolerate its continued defiance of international law and threats to global security. As the United Nations Security Council prepares to impose harsher sanctions on the rogue nation, the world is prepared for a potential backlash from North Korea. The country's leader Kim Jong-un has a history of responding with provocative actions to international pressure and many experts believe he may be planning another nuclear test or missile launch in the coming weeks. The stakes are high with the United States, Japan and South Korea pledging to adopt a tough stance against North Korea's aggression.",

The CDC director said that while the evidence is mounting, more research is needed to confirm the suspected link between Zika and microcephaly. The two cases in Brazil where infants died shortly after birth are particularly concerning as they suggest that the virus may be more severe than previously thought. Dr. Frieden remarked that the CDC is working closely with Brazilian officials to investigate the cases and gather more data.In addition to the suspected link to microcephaly, Dr. Frieden warned that Zika may also be associated with other neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare condition that can cause paralysis. The CDC is urging pregnant women to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites, especially in areas where the virus is circulating. In the meantime, the CDC is recommending that pregnant women reconsider travel to areas where the Zika infection is present, and that they take steps to prevent mosquito bites such as insect repellent and wearing long-sleeved clothing. The WHO declaration of a global health emergency is expected to mobilize international resources and coordination to combat the outbreak. As the situation continues to unfold, Dr. Frieden said that the CDC is working closely with international partners to share data, coordinate research and develop a global response to the crisis.

She was struck by one of the bikes and suffered serious head and leg injuries. Emergency services were quickly called to the scene and Violet was airlifted to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, where she remains in critical condition. Her family has been at her side since the accident and they have asked for privacy while waiting for her to recover. Two riders involved in the crash were also taken to hospital, although their injuries are not considered life-threatening. The race was immediately halted following the incident and an investigation was launched to determine the cause of the crash. The racing community has been shaken by the incident, with many taking to social media to express their shock and concern for Violet and the riders involved. The organizers of the event have also issued a statement saying that they are \"deeply saddened\" by the accident and are fully cooperating with the investigation.The community is rallying around Violet and her family, offering support and prayers for her recovery. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with motorsports and the importance of safety measures to protect both riders and spectators. The incident has sparked a wave of concern among motorsport enthusiasts and safety experts that are calling for a review of safety protocols at race events. The event is a tragic reminder of the dangers in motorsports, said John Smith, a safety expert from the Motorsport Safety Council. \"We need to take a closer look at the safety measures in place to ensure that riders and spectators are protected. \"The race circuit where the incident occurred has been criticized in the past for its proximity to residential areas.

And predicting a famine - however certain the aid agencies are about it - will always be less sexy than the real thing.The financing of humanitarian work depends to a large extent on media coverage - from the coins put in charity boxes to the much larger sums given by governments.In this case the agency experts have even put dates on the coming hunger in South Sudan - August to November.It will be interesting to see how much impact the prediction makes.It didn't work in late 2010 when the United Nations and others sounded the alarm about an impending famine in Somalia and elsewhere in the Horn of Africa.The warning bells were more or less ignored and in 2011 the worst hunger crisis this century has seen so far duly took place.That was sexy.

The cost of an appeal is high and we risk not being able to raise enough money to make a meaningful difference. The conflict in South Sudan has resulted in widespread displacement, with over one million people forced to flee their homes. Many are living in makeshift camps where they struggle to access basic necessities like food, water, and shelter. The situation is particularly dire for children who are at risk of malnutrition and apathetic disease. DEC calls on the public to donate generously to its appeal, which will support the work of its member charities in providing aid to those affected by the conflict. The charities are working to provide emergency food, shelter and medical care to those in need, as well as supporting longer-term projects to help communities recover from the crisis. \"The people of South Sudan are facing a desperate situation and need our help,\" said Saeed. \"We urge the public to donate what they can to our appeal and help spread the word about the crisis in South Sudan. Together, we can make a difference and help to prevent a catastrophe. \"To donate to DEC's South Sudan appeal, visit their website or call their donate hotline. The Disaster Emergency Committee (DEC) launched an emergency appeal to raise vital funds for the people of South Sudan, where a devastating conflict left millions in need of human help.

In his speech, Santorum stated that his Republican opponents are simply talk and no action when it comes to addressing the concerns of working-class Americans. He also criticized President Obama’s handling of the economy and national security, saying the country needs a leader who will stand up for America and defend his values. \"Santorum's campaign is expected to focus on a few key states, including Iowa, where he won the caucuses in 2012, as well as Pennsylvania and other Rust Belt States where he has strong links. Santorum will need to perform well in these states to make momentum and stay competitive in the race. Overall, Santorum's campaign launch was a strong start but still faces a tough road ahead.

While planning the bombing, they alleged, he presented himself as Sami Issa - the registered owner of three jewellery shops, an apartment in Jounieh and a motor boat, who said he was from a Christian village.Hezbollah has denied any involvement in the Hariri assassination.After Mughniyeh was killed in a car bombing in Damascus in 2008 - reportedly the result of a joint operation by Israel's Mossad spy agency and the US Central Intelligence Agency - Badreddine is believed to have taken over most of his duties as commander of Hezbollah's military wing.Badreddine was himself targeted for assassination in January 2015, when a suspected Israeli air strike in the Syrian Golan Heights killed six Hezbollah fighters, including Mughniyeh's son Jihad and an Iranian Revolutionary Guards general, the New York Times reported, citing an intelligence operative in the region. Badreddine had dropped out of the gathering at the last minute, it said.His death was initially blamed on Israel, Hezbollah's chief enemy.But Hezbollah later said its commander had been killed in a bombardment carried out by Sunni extremists.

His low profile only added to his mystique, and he was feared and respected by his enemies and allies alike. The news of Badreddine's death sent shockwaves through the Middle East, with many analysts predicting that it could have significant implications for the power balance in the region. The military operations of Hezbollah in Syria are seen as crucial to the survival of the Assad regime and Badreddine could create a power vacuum that could be exploited by rival factions. The US State Department issued a statement welcoming the news of Badreddine's death, which stated that it was a \"significant blow\" to Hezbollah's military capabilities. \"Badreddine was responsible for Hezbollah's military operations in Syria, and his death will likely undermine the group's ability to wage war in the region,\" said a spokesperson of the State Department. Iran, Hezbollah's main backer, also issued a statement mourning Badreddine's death. \"The martyrdom of Mustafa Badreddine is a great loss for the resistance front and the people of Lebanon,\" said a statement from the Iranian Foreign Ministry. In Lebanon, thousands of Hezbollah supporters gathered to mourn Badreddine's death in the southern suburbs of Beirut. Many of Hezbollah flags and chanted slogans praising the group's military prowess are expected to take place in the coming days with many senior Hezbollah officials and Iranian dignitaries expected to attend. The ceremony is likely to be a highly choreographed affair, with tight security measures in place to prevent any potential attacks. As the region comes to terms with the news of Badreddine's death, many are asking what will be the implications for the ongoing conflict in Syria and the broader Middle East.

        "text": "Culture, Welsh language and communications committee has warned that there is a risk of prioritizing language category change over improving the language proficiency of students in all schools. The committee's report highlights that 75% of Welsh pupils attend English-medium schools and that these schools could be a rich source of future Welsh speakers if given the right support.Senator Bethan Jenkins AM stated: \"We believe that the Welsh Government's strategy could be too focused on changing the language category of schools instead of exploring other ways to increase the number of Welsh speakers. With better outcomes, future English-medium schools could be a valuable source of Welsh speakers. The report also raises concerns over the lack of evidence to support the need for additional resources and investments required to achieve the government's goals, especially in the early years of education. The Welsh Government will discuss the report before giving a complete response but a spokesperson has already indicated that work has been done in several areas mentioned in the report, after a period of consultation on draft plans. The findings of the committee have sparked questions about the Welsh Government's strategy and its plans to move schools along the \"linguistic continuum\" This could potentially mean changing the status of a school from bilingual to Welsh-maternal, as seen in the case of Llangennech in Carmarthenshire. The report of the committee concludes that education plays a crucial role in achieving the Government's objectives and that there is a clear risk that the current approach could have a negative impact on educational priorities. The report will likely spark a lively debate about the best way to promote the Welsh language and improve language skills in Welsh schools.",

But it could allow the 60-euro daily ceiling on withdrawals to be raised a bit and the total freeze on transfers abroad to be eased somewhat.And that might allow the Greek economy to be taken out of the deep freeze it has been in since banks were ordered to more-or-less close last Monday.But if Greeks vote \"No\", as the government wishes them to do, there would be zero chance of the ECB turning on the ELA tap again.And as I said a few days ago, a \"No\" vote might persuade the ECB to demand additional collateral from banks to cover the risk of losses on the 120bn euros in emergency lending it and the Bank of Greece have already provided.This would be very painful for the banks. Right now they have unencumbered assets sufficient to borrow an additional 17bn to 20bn euros from the Bank of Greece, if the ELA ceiling were lifted.But if the ECB decided these assets - such as loans to Greek companies - are intrinsically less valuable than it currently thinks, and imposed a bigger so-called haircut on these loans, that 17bn to 20bn of possible additional credit could shrink to zero or a negative number.Or to put this more clearly, rather than lending to banks, the Bank of Greece and ECB could start to demand some of their outstanding credit back. Which none of the banks are in any position to give.Greek banks would go from their current frozen state to totally and utterly crippled. Which would dash any chance of them providing the fuel to re-start the Greek economy.And that would create a vicious cycle of more of the loans they've made to businesses and households going bad. Which in turn would wreak further damage on the banks.So there is a heavy responsibility both on Greek voters and then the European Central Bank over the next 48 hours. They will decide whether the Greek financial system and Greek economy stands or falls.",

It is like living on a knife’s edge\", said a senior executive at a large Greek bank who wished to remain anonymous. Then, the truth is, no one really knows what will happen next. \"The banks are already feeling the strain and depositors have withdrawn billions of euros in the last few weeks. The decision by the European Central Bank to cap emergency money to Greek banks has only added to the confusion. \"We are doing our best to keep business as usual, but it gets harder by the day\", said another bank source. \"If the 'no' camp wins, we're looking at a potentially catastrophic scenario. The thought of having to convert all our deposits and loans into drachmas keeps me up at night. The Greek government meanwhile is calling on voters to reject the austerity measures proposed by the country's creditors, which would lead to further economic hardship. But the banks know that a vote of \"no\" would likely lead to a cut in funding from the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, making it impossible for them to stay afloat. \"It's a Catch-22 situation\", said a financial analyst in Athens. \"If the Greeks vote 'yes', they will accept more austerity measures that will harm their economy. But if they vote 'no' they risk a complete collapse of their banking system. In either way, it's a lose-lose situation. \"As the referendum approaches the banks are bracing themselves for the worst. They're trading cash, imposing strict limits on withdrawals and prepared for the possibility of a bank holiday. But even with all their contingency planning they can't shake off the feeling that they are in the abyss. It's a nightmare scenario,\" said the senior executive. \"We're talking about the possible collapse of an entire bank system. It's a prospect that is too terrifying to contemplate. As the clock ticks down to the referendum, the sense of uncertainty is palpable. The streets of Athens are filled with protesters both for and against the austerity measures and the tension is building.The Greek government, led by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, is insisting that a \"no\" vote is the only way to secure a better deal for Greece. The banks also know that this is a high-risk strategy and that the consequences of a negative vote could be disastrous. \"We are not talking just about banks\" said a senior economist in Athens.",

London Mayor's comments were seen as a subtle warning to the EU that the UK is willing to leave the negotiating table if its demands are not met. This stance is likely to be welcomed by Eurosceptics in the Conservative Party, who have been pushing for a more robust approach to the EU-Petersen negotiations. Johnson's intervention comes at a crucial moment, as the EU referendum looms large on the horizon. The government has promised to hold the referendum by 2017 and the outcome is far from certain. Opinion polls suggest that the British public is deeply divided on the issue, with some polls showing a narrow lead for the \"out\" campaign while others suggest that the \"out\" campaign is gaining momentum. The EU negotiations are expected to be a long and complicated process with the UK seeking to negotiate its membership terms and secure a better deal for British taxpayers. However, the EU has already indicated that it is unwilling to make significant concessions and that the negotiations are likely to be fraught with difficulty. In his speech, Mr. Johnson praised Mr. Cameron's efforts to reform the EU by announcing that the prime minister had done \"a fantastic job\" in setting out the UK's demands. However, he cautioned that the EU must be willing to listen to Britain's concerns and meet its demands if it wants to keep the UK within the bloc. The debate over the EU referendum is likely to dominate British politics in the coming months, with both sides of the argument set for a fierce battle. Mr. Johnson's intervention is likely to be seen as a significant moment in the debate, as he is one of the most prominent politicians in the country and has a large following among conservative voters.

The Scotstoun site will also be expanded to accommodate the increased workload. The news has been welcomed by local politicians and trade unions who had been campaigning to save the Govan Yard. \"This is a fantastic outcome for the workers at Govan and Scotstoun and the local community,\" said Scottish Secretary David Mundell. It's a testament to the skills and expertise of the workforce that BAE has chosen to invest in these sites. \"Unite the Union, which represents many workers on the yards, praised the decision also. \"This is a huge relief for our members and their families,\" said a union spokesperson. For months, we have been fighting to save Govan and we are thrilled that BAE saw the sense and decided to invest in both sites. The investment is expected to create new jobs and secure the future of the shipbuilding industry in Glasgow for generations to come. The Type 26 warship program is expected to create hundreds of jobs and generate millions of pounds for the local economy. BAE Systems is one of the largest defense contractors in the world and its shipbuilding division is a major player in the global naval industry. The company has a long history of building warships for the Royal Navy, and the Type 26 program has been one of the most significant projects to date in recent years. The decision to invest in the Govan and Scotstoun sites is seen as a major vote of confidence in the UK shipbuilding industry and is expected to have a positive impact on the local economy. The investment is also expected to have a ripple effect on the local supply chain, with many small and medium-sized businesses in the area expected to benefit from the increased activity. \"This is a massive boost for the local economy,\" said council leader Susan Aitken from Glasgow City Council. The shipbuilding industry has a long and proud history in Glasgow and this investment will help to ensure its future for generations to come. We look forward to working with BAE Systems to maximize the benefits of this investment for the people of Glasgow.

Malaysia's Deputy Transport Minister Abdul Aziz bin Kaprawi described it as a \"powerbank\", the AFP agency said.Mr Leoncelli, a former professional Australian Rules football player, said it had two antennae and what appeared to be a smartphone input.He said the suspect told airline staff he needed to see the captain before becoming \"really agitated\" and making threats, including making button-pressing motions. \"I went back to tell the other passengers there was a real threat here, we need to do something,\" Mr Leoncelli said.Of the passengers who then overpowered the man, he said: \"I cannot tell you their names but they are good fellas. \"Earlier, Mr Leoncelli told Melbourne's 3AW radio station that the man threatened to \"blow the plane up\", prompting staff to scream for help.Malaysia Airlines said the Airbus A330, carrying 337 passengers and crew, was in the air for just 30 minutes of its eight-hour flight time before landing.Heavily armed police boarded the plane just before midnight local time (14:00 GMT) and placed the man under arrest.Mr Ashton defended what local media said was a 90-minute delay between the plane landing and police intervention.He said counter-terrorism officers had feared there may be other explosive devices or potential suspects on board. \"If we had an incident where there were further explosives that were triggered, we could have had a mass casualty incident,\" he said. \"Decisions had to be made about what was the safest way to get passengers off the plane. \"Mr Ashton said man had been living in Melbourne on a current visa, clarifying earlier information he was an Australian citizen.A number of flights were diverted following the incident, but the airport confirmed it was operating as normal.Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning",

The 4-2 aggregate defeat, including a 3-0 thrashing at the Allianz Arena, has left Chelsea's season in shattering. The team's inconsistent form in the Premier League has seen them struggle to keep pace with the top four, and their European exit has added to the sense of disappointment. Manager Frank Lampard faces a tough task in lifting his team's spirits and driving it to a top-four finish. The Blues' next five fixtures, which include matches against Liverpool, Everton and Manchester City, will be crucial in determining their fate.The hierarchy of Chelsea, including owner Roman Abramovich, will be concerned about the financial implications of missing out on the Champions League football. The club's revenue is heavily dependent on their participation in the competition, and a season without it could have significant implications for their transfer budget and overall financial stability. The Blues players will also be aware of the importance of finishing in the top four. A number of key players, including Willian and Olivier Giroud, are out of contract in the summer and the lure of Champions League football could be a decisive factor in their decision to stay or leave Chelsea. The players and coaching staff will need to regroup and refocus if they are to salvage something from a disappointing campaign. With the stakes higher than ever, the next few weeks of the Blues will be crucial in determining their European fate. Lampard is mounting pressure on to deliver a top four finish and the Chelsea boss will know that his recent performances have been far from convincing. The Blues have struggled to find consistency, with a lack of cohesion in the midfield and a porous defense that has been exposed time and time again. The absence of a clinical striker has also been a major concern, Tammy Abraham's form dropping in recent weeks. The young Englishman has taken the burden of leading the line, but his lack of experience was evident in the big games.

She also claimed that she was not free to choose her own hours or to decline jobs and was thus entitled to the same rights as employees. The Tribunal agreed with them and stated that Ms. Dewhurst was “integrated into the business” and was not running her own business as a self-employed individual. The ruling means she will be entitled to holiday pay, sick pay and the national living wage, which could have significant implications for City Sprint and other companies operating in the gig economy. \"This is a landmark ruling that highlights the need for companies to take responsibility for their workers, said a spokesperson for the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain which supported Ms. Dewhurst's case. \"For too long, companies exploited workers by denying them basic rights and benefits. This ruling sends a clear message that this is no longer acceptable The ruling is likely to have significant implications for the gig economy which has grown rapidly in recent years. Companies like Uber, Deliveroo and Amazon Flex faced criticism for their treatment of workers who are often classified as self-employed and denied basic rights and benefits.The UK government has announced plans to introduce new legislation to protect workers in the gig economy, but critics argue that more needs to be done to ensure that workers are protected. \"This ruling is a step in the right direction, but we need more action from the government to protect workers in the gig economy,\" said a spokesperson for the Trades Union Congress. Company ownership must take responsibility for their workers and provide them with the rights and benefits they deserve. The case is likely to be closely watched by companies operating in the gig economy and could have significant implications for the way that they classify and treat their workers.",

Their return to work helped to boost information technology employment by 44,000.The Labor Department figures indicated that wage growth remained tepid, rising by just 0.1% in June from the month before. However, earnings were 2.6% higher compared with June last year, up from a rate of 2.5% in May.Market watchers welcomed the stronger-than-expected jobs figures. \"It has been a month of huge shocks for the global economy, but what you can hear now is a massive sigh of relief from the markets. The disastrous May non-farm payroll reading followed by Brexit were very painful, yet there is now a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel,\" said Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com. \"Although the Federal Reserve will take encouragement from this vital data, they simply aren't in a position to consider a rate hike at the moment. There is still huge uncertainty around the world, but the US economy has at least taken a step in the right direction here. \"Earlier this year there had been speculation that the Fed could raise interest rates as soon as July. However, May's disappointing jobs report and the uncertainty following the UK's vote to leave the EU  appeared to have pushed any rate rise well into the future.Andrew Hunter, assistant economist at Capital Economist, said the latest jobs figures could bring forward the time when the Fed might act. \"The surge... suggests that the sharp slowdown in the preceding months was nothing more than a blip,\" he said. \"Fed officials will want to see evidence of a more sustained recovery in employment growth over July and August as well, but this nonetheless supports our view that the next hike could still be in September.\"",

The yield on US government bonds also rose, with the 10-year Treasury note - 1.73% rising - being despite the strong employment growth - wages remained stagnant - average hourly earnings was only 0.1% in June. This has led some to warn that the economy may not be as strong as the unemployment numbers suggest. As a result, the economic growth of the jobs is certainly welcome but the lack of wage growth is a concern,\" said Jane Doe, an economist at ABC University. It suggests that many Americans still struggle to make ends meet. \"The revision of May employment numbers by the Labor Department also drew attention, with the initial estimate of 38,000 jobs being revised to just 11,000. This is the second consecutive month of weak job growth and has led some to question the sustainability of the current economic expansion.Overall, however, the June jobs report is seen as a positive sign for the US economy and has helped increase the confidence in the markets. As the Fed considers its next move on interest rates, all eyes will be on the upcoming inflation data to see if the strong jobs growth is translating to higher prices.",

But Mr Tsipras agreed to the lenders' demands as the price for keeping Greece in the euro.What are the immediate priorities?The MoU demands \"prior actions\" which Greek MPs must make law immediately.The prior actions are aimed at boosting budget revenue and call on the government to:What are the key economic targets?The bailout aims to: put privatisation back on track, modernise and slim down the state administration, tackle tax evasion and fraud, open up regulated professions to competition, and cut pension costs to make the welfare system sustainable.It is a three-year bailout programme (2015-2018), to be provided in instalments by the EU's main bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). It is based on an outline agreement reached at a special EU summit on 13 July.The wide-ranging MoU sets deadlines for the many economic reforms required. At every stage the Greek government will have to consult closely with the lenders.The MoU recognises \"the need for social justice\", so that \"the burden of adjustment is borne by all parts of society\". However, it does not offer debt relief - despite Syriza's argument that Greece's crippling debts are unsustainable.There will be no discussion of debt relief until after the lenders' first review in October.The Greek government is required to achieve a primary budget surplus (a surplus minus interest payments) of 3.5% of GDP by 2018. The targets to reach that are: a 0.25% deficit this year, 0.5% surplus in 2016 and 1.75% surplus in 2017.Those targets are tough - but not as tough as originally envisaged, because the Greek economy is expected to shrink by 2.3% this year. It has spent most of the past seven years in recession.Greek economy returns to growthWhat about the banks?Greece's banks remain in a fragile state - they depend on emergency ECB funding and cannot borrow in capital markets.Strict capital controls remain in force - Greeks are limited to withdrawing €420 a week from their accounts.The banks were closed for three weeks in June-July, to prevent a bank run by anxious customers, who feared economic meltdown and \"Grexit\" - exit from the euro. The controls put a severe brake on economic activity.Under the new bailout terms, Greek banks are getting €10bn, aimed at recapitalising them by the end of the year.",

        "text": "The election, scheduled to take place in September, will likely delay the implementation of the austerity measures and reforms agreed with the European Union. Tipras' decision to call an election comes after a significant number of MPs from his own Syriza party refused to back the bailout deal, which includes pension cuts, tax hikes and other unpopular measures. The rebels argue that the deal goes against the anti-austerity platform of the party and the mandate given to them by the Greek people in last year's election. The Greek Prime Minister who rose to power on a wave of anti-austerity sentiment has seen his popularity drop in recent months as the economy struggles to recover from the crisis. Despite his efforts to negotiate a better deal with the EU, Tsipras has been forced to accept a package that is widely believed to be imposed by Greece's creditors.The election is likely to be a referendum on the bailout deal and the austerity measures that come along with it. Tsipras will hope to win a fresh mandate from the Greek people to implement the reforms, but the result is far from certain. The opposition New Democracy Party, which has been critical of Tsipras' handling of the crisis, is likely to capitalize on the U-turn of the Prime Minister about austerity. The EU has expressed concern about political uncertainty in Greece and is advising European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker that the election could delay the implementation of the bailout deal. The International Monetary Fund, which is also involved in the bailout program, has said that it will not distribute any funds until the Greek government has implemented the agreed reforms. Ahead of the elections, the stakes could not be higher. The future of the country in the eurozone hangs in balance and the result of the election has far-reaching consequences for the entire European Union. The Greek people are poised for a turbulent election campaign, with the future of the country being precariously in doubt. The election, expected to take place in September, will be a decisive moment for Greece as it grapples with the harsh realities of its economic crisis. The decision of Tipras to call an election has sent shockwaves throughout the European Union with many leaders expressing concern about the potential consequences of a Greek exit from the eurozone. The European Commission has warned that failure to implement the agreed reforms could lead to a catastrophic collapse of the Greek economy, with huge consequences for the entire EU. The opposition party New Democracy, led by Vangelis Meimarakis, has been quick to capitalize on Tsipras' U-turn on austerity and accuses the Prime Minister of betraying the trust of the Greek people.",

Working people facing this cost-of-living crisis are on average Â£1,600 a year worse off since David Cameron came to office,\" she added.Economists said the fall in the inflation rate was likely to underline the Bank of England's message that there is no rush to raise interest rates.Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said rates were now likely to stay at 0.5% until early next year despite the improved growth in the economy.Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said he expected inflation to fall even further. \"A favourable combination of lower import prices, flat commodity prices and recovering productivity is likely to help CPI inflation fall further, perhaps to about 1% by the end of the year,\" he said.As well as the impact of a drop in petrol prices, the ONS said the price of clothing and footwear had also increased at a slower pace than the same period last year, and energy bills also had a downward effect on inflation.However, the price of furniture and home furnishings rose by more than last year, the ONS said.A separate survey from the CBI, also released Tuesday, suggested that retail sales had grown in March, but at a slower pace than expected.The business lobby group said 23% of retailers saw sales volumes fall compared to a year ago, while 36% reported a rise.However, respondents to the CBI Distributive Trades Survey said they expected sales to pick up again in the year to April. \"If realised, this will bring the growth rate back into line with February, which was the strongest seen since the onset of the financial crisis,\" the CBI said.It said the later timing of Mother's Day and Easter this year had contributed to March's sales slowdown.",

This marks a significant decline from the rate of 2.8% seen in January and is now below the target of 2% from the Bank of England. Retail Prices Index (RPI) also saw a decrease, falling to 2.7% in February from 2.8% in the previous month. The drop in inflation is largely attributed to a drop in fuel prices, with average petrol prices falling to 0.8p a litre between January and February compared to a 4p increase last year. Diesel prices also saw a decline, dropping 0.8p per litre in comparison to a 3.7p increase the year before. The narrowing gap between the rise in pay and the rise in the prices is a welcome sign for many Britons who have been struggling to make ends meet in recent years. According to ONS, the average global income rose 1.4% in the three months to January compared to a year ago. While public sector workers saw a modest rise of 0.9% in the same period, the private sector reported a more robust 1.7% rise, which means it has already caught up to the rise in prices. Prime Minister David Cameron took to Twitter to comment on the figures and stated that they support the government's economic strategy. \"Today's inflation figures show that our long-term economic plan is working,\" he tweeted. \"We're helping hardworking people by keeping prices low and supporting businesses to create jobs. The fall in inflation is expected to have a positive impact on consumer spending and economic growth as people have more disposable income to spend on goods and services. But some experts have warned that the fall in inflation could also be a sign of a slowing economy and that the Bank of England may need to consider cutting interest rates to stimulate growth. One thing is clear as the UK economy continues to evolve : the fall in inflation is a welcome relief for many Britons who have been struggling to make ends meet in recent years. However, whether this trend will continue remains to be seen, but for now it is a positive sign for the UK economic future.",

This is not about denying care to anyone, but about ensuring that we target our resources effectively.

Internationally there were more new subscribers than anticipated, suggesting the chip excuse may be a valid one.As for its future direction, Netflix's chief executive Reed Hastings and chief content officer Ted Sarandos told investors the company was looking to compete with the likes of Vice, but Netflix's PR team later stepped in to clarify that this didn't mean Netflix had its eye on becoming a news organisation.It's only natural that Netflix would be looking to add new genres to its original programming offer.

According to sources, the boat was found by the Thai navy on Tuesday, but instead of providing assistance, the authorities pushed the vessel back to sea, citing concerns about the spread of COVID-19. The refugees claim that the Thai navy also provided them with some food and water but not enough to sustain them for an extended period of time. The Rohingya refugees who have been on the seabed for over a week now face a humanitarian crisis. Many are suffering from dehydration, hunger and exhaustion, with some reportedly dying on board. The exact number of fatalities is not known, but sources indicate that at least a dozen people have lost their lives since the boat started sailing. The incident has sparked widespread outrage, with human rights groups and international organizations condemning Thailand's actions. \"Pushing back a boat carrying hundreds of desperate and vulnerable people is a clear violation of international law and humanitarian principles\" said a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).The UNHCR has urged Thailand and other countries in the region to give assistance to the stranded refugees and to respect their right to seek asylum. The organization has also called for a regional response to the crisis that has led to thousands of Rohingya fleeing Myanmar in recent years. The incident is the latest in a series of similar incidents in the region in which Rohingya refugees were turned away by authorities or left to fend for themselves on sea. The crisis has highlighted the need for a more comprehensive and humane approach to the crisis of the Rohingya refugee camp, which has been described as one of the worst humanitarian disasters of our time. The Thai government has defended its actions, citing concerns about the spread of COVID-19 and the need to protect its citizens. But human rights groups have accused the government of prioritizing its own interests over the lives of the refugees. \"This is a clear example of the callous disregard for human life of the Thai government,\" said a spokesperson for Amnesty International. Instead of providing aid to people in desperate need they leave them to die at sea. It is a shameful and inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis. \"The incident has also sparked widespread criticism from the international community, with many countries and organisations calling for Thailand to take immediate action to help the stranded refugees. \"The international community cannot sit idly as innocent people are left to suffer and die on the water\", said a spokesperson for the European Union. \"We urge the Thai government to take immediate action to provide aid to these refugees and to respect their right to seek asylum.

It was Labour where they were uniformly wrong. They also overestimated UKIP and the SNP.Survation were closest to the actual result. Kantar Public's numbers were also reasonably good.YouGov's final poll, like most of the others, seriously underestimated Labour. Prior to that, they had been suggesting a closer race. They also had a separate seat projection model which had been indicating a hung parliament. That had been met with a lot of scepticism but, with hindsight, was pretty accurate.In the final weeks of the campaign, the polls were often criticised for being \"all over the place\". It's true that they were pointing to very different outcomes.That variation clearly made it difficult to interpret what they were saying. It's surely better, though, that they had different numbers than that they were all wrong in exactly the same way. If you're looking for consistent accuracy then opinion polls are probably not for you.Pollsters are also sometimes accused of herding - deliberately manipulating their figures so they all say the same thing. That accusation can't be levelled at this election.In 2015 the polls went wrong because their samples were not representative of the electorate - they contained too many Labour voters. They also failed to estimate the difference in turnout rates between different age groups - they overestimated turnout among young voters.The pollsters who were furthest from the actual result this time were those, like ICM and ComRes, who had taken the strongest measures to try to rectify the problem from 2015. Survation made no significant changes to their methodology and came out on top.It looks as though the errors this time were caused, at least in part, by fighting the last war.We'll never know the exact figures for turnout among young voters - it's a secret ballot remember - but YouGov's post-election estimate puts it at 57% for 18-19 year olds and 59% for 20-24 year olds.That's lower than for older voters but considerably higher than estimates for young voters in 2015.We can also see that the places where the number of voters increased the most were generally those with young populations. The assumption made by some pollsters that young turnout would continue to under-perform was probably wrong.",

As the Conservative party begins to form a new government, Prime Minister [Name] will face the daunting task of delivering on her campaign promises, including negotiating a Brexit deal that satisfies the demands of her party's Eurosceptic wing while also addressing the concerns of Remain voters. One of the first challenges that she faces is the need to rebuild her party's relationship with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which has been a crucial ally in the previous parliament.

The maximum penalty could have been seven years.Tsang was cleared last week of a second count of misconduct, while the jury failed to reach a verdict on a third charge of accepting an advantage. He is expected to be retried on that charge in September.After sentencing, he was taken from court in handcuffs to the hospital where he has been staying since experiencing chest pain on Monday.When the presiding judge asked Mr Tsang to stand for sentencing, the former chief executive took a sip of water and closed his eyes. He kept his eyes closed during most of the sentencing speech and appeared to calm himself with a rhythmic breathing exercise.Five years of investigations and weeks of trial had culminated in this humiliating moment.It was an ignominious end for a man who used to be the pride of Hong Kong - someone who had overcome a humble start in life to hold three of the city's top jobs.Mr Tsang's legacy and reputation are in tatters and the judge acknowledged it, saying he had never before seen a man fall so far, so fast.The case has worried a territory that prides itself on its relatively clean reputation.The trial related to events which took place near the end of his term, between 2010 and 2012.Prosecutors accused Mr Tsang of inappropriate and undeclared conflicts of interest, including renting a luxury flat in mainland China from the shareholder of a broadcast company whose licence applications he approved. They also alleged the flat was redecorated free of charge and that he later nominated the interior designer for an honour.The jury found him guilty of misconduct over his failure to disclose the lease of the flat, but dismissed the charge related to the designer and did not reach a verdict on whether he accepted a bribe in the form of the refurbishment.A career civil servant, Tsang rose through the ranks to become Hong Kong's second chief executive, following Tung Chee-hwa.His deputy, former Chief Secretary Rafael Hui, was jailed for accepting bribes from a property tycoon in 2014.",

The case against Tsang centered around his failure to disclose his dealings with a property developer who was also a large shareholder in a Hong Kong television network. During the trial, Tsang was accused of accepting a luxury apartment in Guangzhou, China, at a significantly discounted price, as well as other favors, in exchange for his support for the developer’s business interests. During the trial, prosecutors alleged that Tsang had lied about his dealings with the developer and had concealed his ownership of the apartment from the public. The court heard that Tsang had also accepted other gifts and favors, including a luxury car and a trip to China, without disclosing them.Tsang's defense team had argued that the former CEO was not guilty of misconduct, citing his long history of public service and his commitment to the people of Hong Kong. However, the judge rejected these arguments, saying that Tsang’s actions were a clear breach of public trust. The sentence is seen as a major blow to Tsang's reputation and a significant victory for the Anti-corruption efforts in Hong Kong. The territory has long been known for its clean government and strong institutions, and the conviction of a former chief executive is a rare and significant event. The case has also sparked a widespread debate about corruption and accountability in Hong Kong with many urging greater transparency and stronger measures to prevent abuse of power. The court has indicated that they will appeal the sentence, but for now the former chief executive will begin serving his term in prison. The verdict sent shockwaves throughout Hong Kong, with many residents expressing outrage and disappointment at the fall of a once-affitting leader. \"This is a dark day for Hong Kong\", said Emily Wong, a local resident. \"We trusted Tsang to lead our city with integrity and it's devastating to learn that he betrayed that trust. \"The case also sparked concerns about the influence of wealthy business interests on the Hong Kong government.

The joint rally next week is expected to mark the beginning of a more intense campaign push by Mrs. Clinton and President Obama when they seek to energize Democratic voters and take on the Republican nominee in the general election.Although, Senator Sanders campaign said that it will not deter them from continuing to push for a political revolution in the United States. \"We are not going to allow endorsements by establishment politicians in the way of our movement,\" said a Sanders campaign spokesperson. \"We're going to keep fighting for the values and principles that really matter to the American people.\" The endorsement has also sparked a lively debate among political analysts, with some arguing it could be a game-changer for Mrs. Clinton's campaign, while others believe it may not have a significant impact on the outcome of the primary race. \"President Obama's endorsement is a major coup for Hillary Clinton,\" said Dr. Jane Smith, a political scientist at Harvard University. His popularity among the Democrats is still very high, and his support will likely help consolidate her lead among party loyalists and undecided voters. Others argue that this endorsement may not be enough to sway voters who are looking for a more radical change in Washington.",

The new regulations that come into effect on 1 June aim to reduce the attractiveness of the capsules to young children. Manufacturers are required to pack the capsules in opaque boxes making it difficult for children to see the colorful contents. Moreover, the boxes will provide clear warnings about the dangers of ingesting the capsules and are equipped with child-resistant closures to prevent accidental opening. The UK Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, welcomed the new regulations saying: These measures will help to protect young children from the dangers of laundry detergent capsules. We urge parents and caregivers to remain vigilant and keep these products out of the reach of children at all times. The changes are part of a wider effort to improve the safety standards for household products. The EU has also introduced new regulations for other hazardous substances, including buttons and cleaning products. While the new regulations are a step in the right direction, campaigners say more needs to be done to prevent accidental ingestions. \"We need to see a fundamental change in the way these products are designed and marketed,\" said Sarah Jones, a mother whose child was poisoned by a laundry detergent capsule in 2017. We need to make sure that these products are safe for our children and that the manufacturers are held accountable for their actions. The new regulation is urging parents and caregivers to take extra precautions to keep the laundry detergent capsules out of children's reach. The NHS has also launched a public awareness campaign to educate parents about the dangers of accidental ingestion and the importance of seeking immediate medical attention if a child is suspected of ingesting a laundry detergent capsule. The campaign titled \"Safe at Home\" aims to raise awareness about the potential dangers of household products and to provide parents with practical tips on how to keep their children safe. The campaign will contain social media advertisements, posters and leaflets, as well as partnerships with parenting groups and online forums. Amanda Thomas, a pediatrician and spokesperson for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, emphasized the importance of parental vigilance. \"Laundry detergent capsules may look like candy or toys to young children, but they can be extremely dangerous if ingested.",

It says that although demand for new engines for large passenger aircraft remains unchanged, many airlines have been sidelining their older planes in favour of modern, more fuel efficient models.As a result, profits from supplying spare parts and servicing have fallen significantly. In addition, sales of engines for corporate jets have declined sharply.Meanwhile the low price of oil has taken a heavy toll on Rolls-Royce marine engine business, largely because of falling demand from offshore energy companies.Mr East, who is carrying out a structural review of the business, added Rolls-Royce carried \"too much fixed cost\" and was \"inflexible in managing this in response to changes in market conditions\".He is looking for annual cost savings of between £150 and £200m, of which £115m cost savings are expected to come from the company's aerospace and marine division in 2016.More details on the structural review of the company will be announced later in November, Rolls said.Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said yet another profit warning from Rolls had \"shocked investors\", adding that the review of its shareholder payments policy was \"a major negative\".He said: \"The company's prior push to reduce earnings volatility and surprises looks to have been completely unwound, with investors today suffering another major setback. \"Rebuilding confidence in the company's outlook is now paramount for the relatively new chief executive.\"",

Our review of the business will ensure that we are running as efficiently as possible and we will take all necessary steps to restore our financial performance. The company's announcement comes at the heels of a tumultuous year, marked by a series of profits warnings and a major restructuring effort. Rolls-Royce has been working to revamp its operations and reduce costs, but the latest forecast suggests that more drastic measures may be needed. Analysts were quick to respond to the news, with many expressing disappointment and concern about the company's prospects. The news also raised concerns about the impact on the UK economy, as Rolls-Royce is a major employer and contributor to the country's manufacturing sector. As the company navigates this challenging period, all eyes will be on East and his team to see if they can turn things around successfully and restore Rolls-Royce to its former glory. However, one thing is certain: the road ahead will be long and difficult, and the company will have to make some tough decisions to ensure its survival. Rolls-Royce's revised forecast has also raised concerns about the company's ability to meet its long-term goals, including its ambition to become a leader in the electrification of aircraft. The company has invested heavily in electric propulsion technology, but the latest misstep has cast doubt on its ability to achieve its targets. Another analyst added that this is a major blow to Rolls-Royce's electrification plans. \"The company was already facing significant technical and financial challenges in this area and this latest news will only add to the uncertainty.

He suggested that, if one of them was attacked, the US would be entitled to ask \"have they paid?\" before deciding to go to their assistance.The use of this language has caused alarm in many Nato capitals.There is also concern about suggestions that Mr Trump, as part of a rapprochement with Russia, might be prepared to concede a \"zone of influence\" to the Kremlin in former Soviet republics, or to reduce pressure over the issue of Ukraine. \"Ratifying the results of Russian aggression in Ukraine would buy you some short term stability,\" said Mr Vershbow, when asked about the possibility that Mr Trump might accept the Kremlin calling the shots in eastern Europe in return for better relations. \"But I think it would create a much more unstable situation in Europe, encourage the Russians to continue to press forward for some kind of Yalta 2 with a new division of Europe into spheres of influence, which I think would bring back some of the instability we saw in previous decades. \"Prior to his Nato role, Mr Vershbow was US ambassador to Moscow from 2001-2005.Acquiescing to further Russian operations in Ukraine (which is not a Nato member) might send a signal that the president-elect effectively recognises Russia's right to dominate certain neighbouring states, many Nato decision-makers feel.They fear also a possible knock-on effect in former Soviet republics that are now part of Nato (and indeed the European Union), the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. \"There must be absolutely no doubt about the imperative of defending and protecting Nato territory.

General Shirreff, a decorated British army officer, emphasized that a strong commitment to the NATO collective defence principle is crucial in the face of an increasingly aggressive Russia. They are watching very closely and if they hear any wavering or hesitation on the part of the USA they will exploit it,\" he warned. Vershbow, who has served in various senior roles within the US government, including as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, echoed General Shirreff's concerns. If the US signals that it is no longer committed to NATO's collective defence, it will create a power vacuum that Russia will be only too happy to fill,\" he said.The warnings come as NATO members are already grappling with the challenges of a resurgent Russia. In recent years, Russia has annexed Crimea, supported separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine and has undertaken a series of provocative military exercises along NATO borders. In response to these challenges, NATO has taken steps to bolster its military presence in Eastern Europe, including the deployment of troops and equipment to Poland and the Baltic states. However, the alliance still faces significant challenges in terms of its military capabilities and readiness. General Shirreff and Mr. Vershbows comments are likely to add to the growing pressure on Mr. Trump to clarify his administration's stance on NATO and its commitment to the collective defence principle of the alliance.

Recent history of the national team is littered with instances of promising performances being followed by disappointing defeats and Strachan is determined to avoid a repeat of this pattern. One area where Strachan will be looking for improvement is in Scotland’s attacking play. Despite dominating possession against Malta, the Scots struggled to create clear-cut chances and relied on a pair of set pieces to secure the win. Strachan knows that his team will need to be more clinical in front of the goal if they are to take all three points. \"We need to be creative and more ruthless in the final third,\" Strachan acknowledged.",

In September, the company had issued a global recall of the device after reports of the phone's battery overheating and caught fire. Mobile operators have responded quickly in the UK to the latest developments. EE and Vodafone have both announced that they will no longer be selling the Note 7 while Three said that it will not be offering exchanges for customers who have already purchased the device.O2 has gone one step further by announcing that it will not be selling the Note 7 at all. A company spokesperson said that in light of the recent incidents we have decided not to sell the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. The news has left many customers who already purchased the Note 7 wondering what to do next. Samsung has set up a dedicated website and a hotline for customers to return their devices and receive a refund or exchange. Some customers have expressed frustration over the lack of clarity from Samsung and mobile operators about the recall process. \"I'm not sure yet what I'm supposed to do with my Note 7\", said one customer. I've tried contacting Samsung and my mobile operator, but no one seems to know what is going on. The incident also raised questions about the safety of lithium-ion batteries used in many modern smartphones. The experts have warned that the recall of the Note 7 could have far-reaching implications for the entire smartphone industry.One thing is clear as the situation continues: the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 has become a major embarrassment for the company and a cautionary tale about the importance of safety in the design and manufacture of consumer electronics.",

We need to move away from a system that prioritizes test results over the well-being of our children and the professional treatment of our teachers. \"The Committee's recommendations have been welcomed by teaching unions, who long argued that the current system is too narrow and focuses too much on testing. \"This report is a damning indictment of government education policy,\" said Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers. The emphasis on test has led to a curriculum that is too narrow and too focused on rote learning rather than creativity and critical thinking. The government has nevertheless expressed reservations about the committee's proposals. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said, \"We understand the concerns about the current system, but we believe that testing is an important way to ensure that children are meeting the necessary standards in maths and literacy. We will carefully consider the recommendation of the committee, but we are not convinced that a rolling three-year average is the correct solution. The debate about testing and accountability in schools is likely to continue with many arguing that the current system needs a radical overhaul. As Carmichael said: \"We need to get back to a system that values the whole child, not only their test results. Our children deserve a broad and balanced education that prepares them for life, not just a series of exams. \"The report of the committee is the latest in a series of criticisms of the education policy of the government. The National Association of Head Teachers called for a boycott of the SAT tests last year, citing concerns about the impact on the well-being of the pupil and the narrow focus of the curriculum. The government has also faced criticism over its plans to introduce more grammar schools, which many argue will exacerbate social segregation and inequality.As the debate continues, one thing is clear : the current system of testing and accountability in schools is in need of reform.",

The initial postponement was cited by Haye as a cut above his eye but Fury was frustrated and disillusioned when the fight was finally scrapped. The bad blood between the two fighters has simmered ever since, with Fury often taking to social media to taunt and criticize Haye. Now Fury holds all the aces as the new heavyweight champion and is eager to settle the game one and all a-gain. \"I'd love to come in the ring with Haye and show him what a real fighter looks like,\" said Fury. \"I'd knock him out cold, like I did to Klitschko. He's a has-been, a relic of the past and I am the future of heavyweight boxing. While a fight between Fury and Haye is far from certain, one thing is clear: The blood between these two fighters is very real, and it's only a matter of time before they finally settle their differences in the ring. The battle between Fury and Haye has been ongoing for years, with both fighters trading verbal jabs and insults on social media and in interviews. However, with Fury now holding WBA, IBF and WBO titles, the stakes have never been higher.Haye, who has been out of the ring since 2013, has been quietly planning his comeback. A fight against Fury would be the perfect opportunity to silence his critics and prove that he still has what it takes to be a world-class fighter.",

The report highlighted that MyCSP's performance problems were exacerbated by inadequate planning, insufficient resources and poor communication with stakeholders. In response to the report, MyCSP claimed that its performance was now in a'steady state', suggesting the issues had been addressed. However, the union of public and commercial services (PCS) which represents civil servants was highly critical of the mutualisation of the pensions administration. The PCS union described the MyCSP experience as \"a textbook case in how not to reform public services\". The union argued that the government's decision to outsource pensions to a private sector-led mutual had been a mistake and that the problems encountered by MyCSP were the direct result of this flawed approach. The NAO Report's findings are likely to fuel concerns about the government's plans to mutualise other public services. The author, Amyas Morse, warned that the MyCSP experience highlighted the importance of careful planning and robust risk management when introducing significant changes to public services.The government has faced criticism in the past for its handling of public sector outsourcing contracts with several high-profile failures, including the collapse of Carillion, a major outsourcing firm. The MyCSP Debacle is likely to add to the growing scrutiny of government outsourcing policies and the role of private sector companies in delivering public services. In the meantime, pensioners affected by the delays in pension payments will hope that MyCSP's claims of improved performance are genuine and that they will not experience the \"hardship, distress and inconvenience\" caused by the mutual struggles.",

The North's plutonium stocks are finite, but if it could enrich uranium it could build up a nuclear stockpile.Plutonium enrichment also has to happen in large, easy-to-spot facilities, whereas uranium enrichment can more easily be carried out in secrecy.The first indication was again report of an \"artificial quake\" in North Korea, registering about magnitude 5.1, close to Punggye-ri.North Korea later announced it had conducted its first successful test of a hydrogen bomb.H-bombs, also known as thermonuclear warheads, are massively more powerful than atomic bombs, using fusion - the merging of atoms - rather than fission to unleash enormous amounts of energy.Though again it has never been confirmed, that claim alarmed the international community.Observations from afar suggested the blast detected was not large enough to have been a full thermonuclear device, but may have involved some nuclear fusion.Again, North Korea said the device had been miniaturised.A few months later, Kim Jong-un announced that North Korea scientists had been able to do what had long been feared, and make a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on a warhead.It came after days of threats to carry out \"indiscriminate\" attacks on the US and South Korea.

The test also sparked concerns about the potential for radioactive fallout, although no radiation was detected. February 12, 2013 - A third nuclear testNorth Korea's third nuclear test carried out on February 12 was its most powerful yet. The bomb was estimated to be around 10 kilotons and was widely seen as a significant step forward in the country's nuclear program.The test was conducted in defiance of international warnings and was met with strong condemnation by the United States, South Korea and other countries. The UN Security Council has placed further sanctions against North Korea and the country was also expelled from the International Atomic Energy Agency.6 January 2016 - A Hydrogen Bomb? North Korea's fourth nuclear test, conducted on January 6, 2016, was claimed to be a hydrogen bomb. The explosion was estimated to be around 7-10 kilotons and was seen as a significant escalation of the country's nuclear program. However, many experts questioned whether the test was actually a hydrogen bomb, citing the relatively small yield and lack of evidence of a thermonuclear reaction. Nevertheless, the test sparked widespread concern about the potential for North Korea to develop a more powerful and sophisticated nuclear weapon.9 September 2016 - A Fifth TestNorth Korea's fifth nuclear test, conducted on September 9, 2016, was its most powerful yet. The explosion was estimated to be approximately 10-30 kilograms and was seen as a significant step forward in the country's nuclear program.The test was conducted just days after North Korea launched three ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan, sparking concerns over the country's rapidly improving nuclear and missile capabilities.3 September 2017 - Sixth testNorth Korea's sixth and most recent nuclear test was conducted on September 3, 2017. The explosion was estimated at around 120-160 kilotons and was seen as a significant escalation in the country's nuclear programme. The test was met with widespread condemnation from the international community and sparked concerns about the potential for North Korea to develop a nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States.

Bi, at the time a university student, was rushed to the hospital where she underwent emergency surgery to repair her broken jaw. She spent several days recovering from her injuries in the hospital and was left with a long and difficult road to recovery.

The rise in reported incidents is partly due to a greater awareness among farmers and public about the importance of reporting such crimes. Police Scotland believes that livestock attacks have historically been under-reported and the increased numbers may reflect a growing willingness to come forward and report these incidents. In a positive development, 60% of the incidents this year led to the detection of the involved dogs and their owners being reported fiscally to the procurator. This suggests that efforts are yielding results to tackle the problem, and that those responsible are held accountable. The majority of the offences reported were in Aberdeenshire, Highlands and Islands and Lanarkshire, with sheep being the most commonly affected animal. The attacks not only cause substantial distress to the animals but also cause financial losses for farmers who may be forced to euthanize injured animals or suffer reduced productivity. Police Scotland is urging dog owners to take responsibility for their pets and ensure they are kept under control, especially in rural areas where livestock is present. Farmers are also advised to take precautions to protect their animals, including using fencing and other deterrents to prevent dog attacks.

It helps to connect exporters in China (and other countries) with companies in over 190 countries around the world.The business now includes entertainment services, including China's version of YouTube, Youku Tudou, as well as payment systems and cloud computing and logistics services.Increasingly, Mr Ma is looking to counter the company's reliance on Chinese consumers, with the firm now looking to get up to half of its sales from abroad.Among recent deals to expand was the purchase of South East Asia e-commerce start-up Lazada and Hong Kong's well-respected English language, the South China Morning Post.Another area of potential growth investors are excited about is its payment platform Alipay.Alipay is operated by affiliate Zhejiang Ant Small & Micro Financial Services Group, also known as Ant Financial.Mr Ma controls Ant, which is China's biggest online financial services firm, and is said to be worth around $60bn following its latest fundraising round.",

The significant growth in sales, which increased by a third to 101 billion yuan, can be attributed to the company's successful expansion into mobile commerce. Those sales on mobile devices soared by an astonishing 182%, demonstrating Alibaba's ability to adapt to the changing online shopping landscape. Alibaba's dominance in the e-commerce space is unquestioned with the company handling more transactions than Amazon and eBay combined. Its popular online marketplaces including Taobao and Tmall have become a fundamental part of daily life for millions of Chinese consumers. The company's success can also be attributed to its strategic investments in the cloud computing, digital payments and logistics. Alibaba's cloud computing arm, AliCloud, has become a major player in the industry, while its digital payment platform, Alipay, revolutionized the way people pay for goods and services online. The impressive financial results of Aliaba have sent its stock up by the sea, with investors eager to capitalize on the company's continued growth and expansion. The company's market value has exceeded that of many of its western counterparts, cementing its position as a global e-commerce leader. As Alibaba continues to expand its reach into new markets and industries its impact on the global economy is likely to be significant. The company's success serves as a testament to the growing influence of Chinese businesses on the global stage, and its financial results are being closely followed by investors and analysts around the world.",

He explained: \"We don't want people giving up taking their asthma treatment. \"He also warned against taking vitamin D without advice. \"Going to see your GP is a key part of the message we want to give - I don't think it would be appropriate to just start taking vitamin D without knowing whether you have vitamin D deficiency or not and we don't yet know what the threshold of vitamin D is below which you will have a benefit. \"Dr Rebecca Normansell, a GP from the Cochrane body, said asthma patients are not routinely tested for their vitamin D levels, but following further study \"it may be that that will be something that we should be considering as a reason to test vitamin D\". \"Talking with your pharmacist or GP is a great place to start as there may be other things that could be done for you as well to improve your asthma beyond thinking about your vitamin D,\" she said.Dr Imran Rafi, from the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), called the research \"encouraging\". \"However, more work still needs to be done in gathering the evidence, particularly around effectiveness for young people and children - especially as it currently affects as many as one in 11 children. \"He said he looked forward to seeing the results of further clinical trials to get a better understanding of this potential method of treatment. \"It is important to remember that not every drug is suitable for every patient and if a patient has asthma, they shouldn't make any changes to their medication without first discussing it with their family doctor.\"",

The two males will fight, which could result in the death of one of them,\" he told the BBC.Mr Moehring said the zoo would get six months' notice before the arrival of the female and its priority would be to find a new home for Marius.But he stressed that the move must not harm the carefully regulated genetic make-up of the giraffe population, otherwise Marius will have to be put down.And he defended the decision by Copenhagen to put down its Marius on Sunday. \"I am sure the zookeepers at Copenhagen had a really bad day on Sunday because they love those animals, but they knew it was the best solution for the giraffes there,\" Mr Moehring said.Copenhagen's scientific director, Bengt Holst, said Marius's genes were too similar to those of other animals in the European breeding programme, and he risked introducing rare and harmful genes to the giraffe population if he had been allowed to breed.Mr Holst also defended as scientifically educational his decision to allow visitors - including children - to watch the carcass being skinned, cut up and fed to the lions.His decision caused outrage among animal rights campaigners and has led to death threats against Mr Holst and his staff.The news about Jyllands Park's Marius has prompted an offer of a new home from an unexpected quarter, the leader of the Chechen Republic.Ramzan Kadyrov said in an Instagram post: \"On humanitarian grounds I am ready to take Marius.

The zoo claims that keeping him would take up space and resources that could be better used for more genetically valuable animals. Animal rights activists and experts have criticized the decision, arguing that there are alternative solutions that do not involve euthanizing a healthy animal. In a statement, the EAZA pointed out that Marius could be relocated to a sanctuary or a zoo that is not part of the EAZA breeding program, where he could live out his life without causing a threat to the genetic diversity of the species.The case also highlighted the lack of transparency and accountability in the zoo industry, with many questioning why the zoo did not explore alternative alternatives before making the decision to put him down. The organization has also encouraged zoos to investigate alternative solutions before resuming euthanasia.As the debate continues, animal lovers and experts are calling for a review of the breeding program and its rules, as well as greater transparency and accountability in the zoo industry. The fate of the seven-year-old hybrid giraffe Marius has become a symbol of the need for change and a reminder of the importance of animal welfare. The controversy surrounding Marius' fate has sparked a wider discussion about the ethics of zoos and breeding programs. Many are questioning the morality of putting genetic diversity above the life of a healthy animal. Dr. Jane Smith, a leading expert in animal welfare, stated that it is unacceptable that a zoo would consider euthanizing a healthy animal simply because it isn't deemed 'genetically valuable'. This decision highlights the need for a shift in the way we approach animal conservation and welfare.

It's not always blatantly obvious like a pay gap or races not being put on,\" Barker, who won gold for Team GB in the team pursuit in Rio, said. \"Times have changed a little bit since Nicole's time. \"I can understand her frustrations but, as much as there is sexism in sport today, there's not been a better time to be a female cyclist. I certainly can't complain about the amount of support. \"There are so many more British female riders that can be full-time and don't need to get jobs and hopefully that's going to be on the rise. \"While giving evidence to the committee, Cooke answered \"yes I do\" when asked by MPs whether she thought sexism was culturally embedded in British Cycling.The 2008 road race champion also said they did \"nothing for the women\" and that the body showed only \"transient\" support for female road riders.Regarding Cooke's accusations, British Cycling said in a statement: \"There is always more that can be done and we strive to make continual improvements to ensure that cycling is reaching out to women and girls of all ages and abilities. \"Barker says issues beneath the surface of Cooke's accusations do need to be addressed. \"I think sometimes it's the subtle things that can be quite damaging - the choice of music while the women are racing can often be quite trivial and it downgrades the racing a little bit,\" Barker continued. \"When the men have got awesome rock theme tunes to their racing, it makes it more exciting and it draws the crowd in, whereas when the woman's is on, there's this sort of fluffy music and it doesn't make the crowd that excited. \"There are different levels to it. Equality needs to be across it all rather than just focusing on the pay gap. It needs to be all these little things to raise the profile of women's cycling. \"An independent review into British Cycling was set up after former technical director Shane Sutton was accused of using offensive and discriminatory language towards cyclist Jess Varnish.Sutton was cleared of eight of the nine charges against him, but was found guilty of using sexist language.

A Barker’  - comments come as British Cycling faces scrutiny over allegations of sexism and discrimination within the organization. Cooke's testimony on Tuesday to the Select Committee was highly critical of the governing body, saying that women were often marginalized and overlooked. However, Barker’s experience has been different, and she credits British Cycling for providing her with the support and resources she needed to succeed. \"I've had an amazing career thus far and I feel like I've been given every opportunity to succeed,\" said she. \"I think it is important to recognize the progress that has been made and to continue to push for more. \"The debate over sexism in cycling is likely to continue, but Barker's comments offer a more optimistic view of the state of women's cycling in the UK. As popularity of the sport continues to grow, it remains to be seen whether British Cycling can address the concerns of its critics and provide a more inclusive environment for all athletes. Barker's comments have sparked a lively debate within the cycling community, with many athletes and fans taking to social media to share their own experiences and opinions on the matter. While some have praised Barker for her positive outlook and recognition of progress made, others have criticized her for downplaying the severity of the issue. It is easy for someone who has had a successful career to say that everything is fine but what about those who haven't had the same opportunities? One user.Cooke, who has been a vocal critic of British Cycling, responded to Barker's comments by saying that while she was happy to hear that some women had had positive experiences, it did not change the fact that there were still deep-seated problems within the organization. \"I'm not denying that there are some good people working in British Cycling, but the fact is that there are still many women who have been marginalized and discriminated against\", Cooke said in a statement.",

The three later discovered they were cousins.The trio was almost known as the Meltones or Little Miss and the MuffetsBut they settled on the Dixie Cups name in 1964 after being discovered by producer and singer Joe Jones.Jones took them to New York where they recorded Chapel of Love, written by Spector, Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich.The band came up with the song's unique vocal arrangement on the spot. \"When Ellie and Jeff first played Chapel for us, we looked at each other, like, 'You really want us to sing that like that?'\" Hawkins told Rolling Stone. \"They said, 'Well, how do you want to sing it?' So I said, 'Give us a minute. '\"We went in the corner and started singing. We walked back to them and when we sang it the way it was recorded, they were just, 'Wow! That was awesome. '\"The song peaked at number 22 in the UK and was later covered by the Beach Boys.The Dixie Cups released further successful records in 1964 and 1965, including You Should Have Seen the Way He Looked at Me, Little Bell and a cover of the New Orleans standard, Iko Iko.But when their record label went out of business, the band's recording career effectively ended.Johnson quit soon after citing management and health concerns, having suffered with sickle cell anaemia. \"Because it was the early sixties, we went through a lot as far as race and a whole lot of other things,\" Hawkins said. \"We had a manager who wasn't really in our corner, but there were a lot of good times. \"Johnson occasionally rejoined the band for performances, including one at the 2010 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.She died of congestive heart failure in a New Orleans hospice on 3 October.The singer is survived by a sister, Ida, and a brother, Howard. A memorial is planned in New Orleans next week. \"The world has lost a classy lady, who had a magnificent sense of humour, a radiating smile, and was truly one of the best people we know,\" wrote the Dixie Cups on their website.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

        "text": "Their unique harmonies and energized stage presence quickly gained a following, and they were soon discovered by music producer Joe Jones.Jones brought the Dixie Cups to New York City, where they were introduced to Phil Spector, who was impressed by their talent and agreed to produce their debut single. The result was a catchy, upbeat track that would proceed to become a massive hit. The song's success was swift and unexpected. Released in April 1964, \"Chapel of Love\" shot up to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart and knocked out the Beatles' \"Love Me Do\" number one spot. The song's popularity was fueled by its infectious melody, hand clapping rhythms and the sweet, harmonious vocals of the Dixie Cups. The following singles of the Dixie Cups, including \"People Say\" and \"You Should Have Seen the Way He Looked at Me,\" also charted well, but none achieved the same level of success as \"Chapel of Love.\" Despite this the group remained a popular live act and met notable artists such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and James Brown on tour. In the years following their initial success, the Dixie Cups continued to record music, though with less commercial success. They remained a favorite fixture of the New Orleans music scene, and their legacy as one of the first all-female groups to achieve mainstream success was cementing. In 2004 the Dixie Cups were inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame and in 2014 were awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Today, the group remains a staple of 1960s pop culture and \"Chapel of Love\" continues to be celebrated as a classic of the era. The impact of the Dixie Cups on the music industry extends beyond their own success. They paved the way for future generations of female musicians by inspiring groups like the Supremes and the Ronettes. The music of their bands also influenced a wide range of artists ranging from punk rockers like the Ramones to pop icons like Cyndi Lauper. In recent years, the Dixie Cups have experienced a resurgence in popularity, with their music being included in films, television shows and commercials. \"Chapel of Love\" has become a staple of wedding playlists and its catchy melody and harmonies continue to delight audiences of all ages. Despite the passing of original member Joan Johnson in 2016, the legacy of the Dixie Cups lives on through their music and the memories of their energetic live performances.",
