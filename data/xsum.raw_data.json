They are silent and kids can change the tension so if they feel they have more energy they can crank up the tension. \"Within a week some students started to say they thought they were focusing more and Ms Lambeth noticed that they were more engaged in conversation in class. \"They were able to recall a lot more of what I was saying and because they participated more they understood more and they did better in tests. \"As a result she says their test grades demonstrably improved from when the pedals were introduced in April compared to earlier in the school year.Other teachers using the same classroom have also noticed an improvement in students' grades and parents have reported that their children were more interested in just being in the class.The pedals cost $180 (Â£138) each and were bought with a grant from the local Wake County Public School System.Now the school is hoping to buy more pedals and extend the programme.Staff who work with youngsters on the behavioural support programme area are also interested in seeing if they can make a difference for them.By Annie Flury, UGC and Social News team."

Voting is mandatory in Singapore, with few exemptions allowed.The PAP's main rival - the Workers' Party - ended up with six seats, less than the seven it held in the outgoing parliament. A number of smaller parties also ran.The PAP's success has been attributed to its widespread popularity among Singaporeans - who have seen their country rapidly evolve into a first-world economy - as well as its tight political control.But government stumbles in managing immigration and infrastructure, coupled with a greater desire by younger Singaporeans for political plurality, have led to gains by opposition parties over the years.If the last election was the PAP's nadir, then this one marked its return to glory.In 2011 it scored 60% of the vote share - a good showing by most counts, but it was the party's worst ever performance - thanks to public unhappiness over an influx of foreigners, a housing shortage, and transport breakdowns.It sought to resolve these problems, promised to listen to citizens more, and put in place slightly more generous social welfare policies. On Friday, voters rewarded the party with a bigger mandate.Lingering feel-good vibes from last month's jubilee celebrations, and a renewed sense of gratitude to PAP founder and revered leader Lee Kuan Yew, triggered by his death in March, no doubt also played a part in voters' decisions.The PAP's return to power was widely expected but its large margin was a surprise to many, not least to the main opposition Workers' Party (WP). It campaigned on a platform of providing an effective check on the PAP, but lost a constituency and saw its winning margins reduced in the few seats it retained.The results thus cement the PAP's long-running political dominance in Singapore and highlight the long slog ahead for those pushing for political plurality with an electorate which, for now, appears unconvinced of its merits.Read more: Singapore's elections explained in memes"

        "text": "\"One of the things we found was it's actually very easy to see bubbles forming in stout beer rather than in, say, champagne where the bubble formation process is much more violent,\" Dr Lee told BBC News.But as has happened to a generation of like-minded scientists before them, the question of falling bubbles became their focus.The team had the idea - borne out by calculations carried out by Mr Cummins - that the relative density of bubbles and the surrounding liquid could be behind the phenomenon. \"If you imagine your pint is full of bubbles, then the bubbles will start to rise,\" Dr Lee said.But the bubbles in a standard pint glass find themselves in a different environment as they rise straight up. \"Because of the sloping wall of the pint, the bubbles are moving away from the wall, which means you're getting a much denser region next to the wall,\" Dr Lee explained. \"That is going to sink under its own gravity, because it's less buoyant, and that sinking fluid will pull the bubbles down. \"The bubbles, that is, are \"trying\" to rise, but the circulation that creates drives fluid down at the wall of the glass. \"You'll see sinking bubbles not because the bubbles themselves are sinking, but because the fluid is and it's pulling them down with it. \"The same flow pattern occurs with other beers such as lagers, but the larger bubbles of carbon dioxide are less subject to that drag.Mr Cummins carried out calculations using a simulated pint and \"anti-pint\" - that is, the upside-down version of a pint glass - showing the effect at work; in the anti-pint, the bubbles rise as expected.For those interested in experimenting in the pub, the effect can be best seen if a pint of stout is served in a straight-sided, cylindrical glass (not quite filled up).If the glass is tilted at an angle while the pint settles, the side in the direction of the tilt represents the normal situation of a pint glass, while the opposite side is the \"anti-pint\" - and bubbles can be seen to both rise and fall in the same glass."

Nuclear threats are not a game,\" Mr Ban said.The US has urged China and Russia to apply pressure on Pyongyang to change its Yongbyon plans.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei called for restraint from all sides to resolve the \"complex and sensitive\" situation.Russia's foreign ministry, meanwhile, warned against escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula. \"The main objective is to avoid the forceful military scenario. It is not acceptable to use the situation there (on the Korean peninsula) to try to reach someone's specific military and political aims,\" said ministry spokesman Grigoriy Logvinov.By Kim GhattasBBC state department correspondentNorth Korea - a vexing problem for the USThe BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul says Yongbyon has provided the North with successful leverage in the past.The complex offers Pyongyang two ways of making nuclear bombs - a uranium enrichment facility, and a nuclear reactor, from which the spent fuel can be turned into plutonium.Restarting it gives the regime several cards to play: it secures more material for its nuclear programme, and also re-focuses world attention on how to stop it, our correspondent says.The reactor at Yongbyon - which was the source for plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons programme - was closed in July 2007 as part of a disarmament-for-aid deal.The cooling tower at the facility was later destroyed, but then the disarmament deal stalled.Part of the reason the agreement fell apart was because the US did not believe Pyongyang was fully disclosing all of its nuclear facilities - a suspicion later bolstered when North Korea unveiled a uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon to US scientist Siegfried Hecker in 2010.While it appeared to be for electricity generation purposes, Mr Hecker said the facility could be readily converted to produce highly-enriched uranium for bombs.In a November 2010 report following his visit to Yongbyon, Mr Hecker said that based on what he saw, he believed North Korea could \"resume all plutonium operations within approximately six months\" at Yongbyon if so inclined."

Tanzanian Ahmed Ghailani was jailed for life in 2011 before Congress barred the transfer of any others.Politicians from both parties have said that Guantanamo prisoners do not belong on US soil or in civilian prisons, arguing they are too dangerous.Afghans, Saudis and Yemenis have made up more than 60% of the prisoners, although about 50 different nationalities have been represented.The vast majority of the 779 inmates were released under the previous administration of George W Bush. Nine have died at the prison.Mr Obama has approved regular releases, totalling 161, with detainees heading for resettlement around the world.Only 61 prisoners remain, of whom 20 are approved for release. The key figures left (all of whom have been charged and are currently in pre-trial hearings) are:Figures from the office of the director of national intelligence show that, of the inmates released under George W Bush, 21% were confirmed to have re-engaged in militant activity, while 14% were suspected of having done so.Of the releases under President Obama, only 5% were confirmed to have re-engaged in militant activity and 8% were suspected of having done so.Many of those released have simply returned to their homelands. Many returning Afghans harbour resentment both at why they were sent to Guantanamo Bay and their treatment there. Many still report harassment by security forces although they insist they pose no threat.Among the countries taking inmates in releases under Mr Obama are the UAE, Georgia, Senegal, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Morocco, the UK, Mauritania, Oman, Bosnia, Montenegro, Algeria, Kazakhstan, Uruguay, Estonia and El Salvador.Inevitably the results have been mixed, given cultural differences.Uruguay took six Arab men in December 2014 but later said it would take no more, arguing the ex-inmates had struggled to adapt to the country.One inmate, Abu Bakker Qassi, a Uighur from north-western China, found himself working as a pizza chef cooking halal Italian food in Albania."

Some experience depressive symptoms only briefly, others have remitting and relapsing depression and some people are depressed all the time.Dr Simon Ridley, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said anyone concerned about either condition should seek help. \"The findings suggest that low levels of depression or fluctuating symptoms may not affect dementia risk but that a worsening of symptoms in the over-55s may be an early indicator of diseases like Alzheimer's,\" he said. \"It's important to remember that only a relatively small number of people experiencing symptoms of depression went on to develop dementia during this 11-year study, but anyone concerned about either condition should talk to their GP.\""

        "text": "But reports of the Scot considering his future as a result of his unease with Mendes' sizeable involvement in Wolves' recruitment policy first surfaced earlier this month.Since the Premier League was launched in 1992, Wolves have spent just four of those 25 seasons in the top flight.They first won promotion under Dave Jones in 2003, only to come straight back down again.They then went back up again as champions under Mick McCarthy in 2009, spending three seasons there this time.Over the last 10 seasons, only one manager has taken over a Championship club in the summer, having finished the previous season at the same level, and then won automatic promotion in his first season.That was Steve Bruce, with Hull City in 2012-13 - and with a points haul (79) that would not have been good enough to make this season's play-offs.Having been appointed as Walter Zenga's successor on 5 November, Lambert was in charge for 33 matches in all competitions, of which Wolves won 14, lost 14 and drew five.A run of five successive league defeats in February dragged Wolves into a Championship relegation struggle, although they pulled well clear of the bottom three with five consecutive wins in March and April.They eventually finished 15th, seven points clear of the relegation zone.The highlights of Lambert's reign came in the FA Cup, in which Wolves won at Premier League opponents Stoke City and Liverpool before losing at home to double-chasing Chelsea in the fifth round.Media playback is not supported on this deviceBBC WM's Mike TaylorThe news of Lambert's departure is not surprising, since it is now three weeks since reports of the apparent rift between him and the club first appeared, although no public comment confirming it was ever made by either side.Neither will it be a surprise when, and we expect it will probably be Wednesday, Nuno Espirito Santo is announced as his replacement.This decision by Wolves can be viewed either as a bold step forward with a fresh approach, or another unnecessary risk on a coach with no experience of a particularly treacherous league.What it does appear to make abundantly clear, though, is that the owners Fosun are very much influenced by the agent Jorge Mendes, to a greater degree than they have previously been prepared to admit. Lambert was never going to stand for that.Fans will have their own views on whether that is the right course. The opinions of the club's director Jeff Shi may also turn out to be of interest, given the enthusiastic language he used to describe Lambert's vital importance to the club's management team only a few weeks ago."

There, the Socialist candidate rejected his party's call to pull out.French regions have wide powers over local transport, education and economic development.The far right has been steadily gaining votes over the past few years from both left- and right-wing sympathisers through a mix of nationalist and pro-welfare policies, correspondents say.In the lead-up to the first round, opinion polls suggested that the popularity of the anti-immigration, anti-EU FN had increased since the deadly attacks in Paris on 13 November.Who were Paris attackers?How the Paris attacks unfoldedThe FN is hoping a strong performance will boost Marine Le Pen's chances in the 2017 presidential election.The government's response to the Paris attacks has boosted President Hollande's approval ratings - they have soared more than 30 percentage points to 50%.However, this surge in personal popularity has so far not translated into greater approval for Mr Hollande's Socialist Party."

It narrowly escaped bankruptcy back then by raising money from specialist investors which reduced the wider Cooperative Group share to just 20%.Co-op Bank has been limping along since then with less shock-absorbing capital than the regulator thinks is appropriate for a four million customer bank and the Bank of England stands ready if other options fail. Ultimately, that could mean the dismantling of a 160 year old financial institution and the biggest financial rescue since 2009.To be clear, we are not at that point yet.Potential buyers have until 4 April to submit their bids for the company and there are the options already discussed to raise money after that date. Financial markets are betting heavily against Co-op Bank's survival in its current form, BUT the fact that its bonds are worth anything at all means some investors still think Bank of England intervention is avoidable.Co-op customers have very little to fear as current accounts, personal loans and mortgages would be taken on by another bank if necessary and deposits up to £85,000 are guaranteed by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.Customers of the ethically focused Co-op bank have been very loyal during a period which has seen big losses, branch closures and a drug scandal involving its former non-executive chairman, Paul Flowers dent the financial and ethical integrity of Co-op bank.It may yet live to fight on, but the Bank of England is braced for its failure."

Such twins usually die before birth.The abnormality is estimated to occur in 1 in 500,000 live births.Is it unusual to live so long with the twin?One widely reported case was of a 36-year-old man in India whose tumour had grown so big that he was having difficulty breathing.In villages or smaller towns where access to medical facilities are limited, it is possible for someone to not know they have a foetus and live with it their entire life, says Dr Raman.The abnormality is easily spotted if a baby undergoes an ultrasound or CT scan, and there have been cases of babies as young as three months old being operated on."

Non-Muslims were singled out to be killed.Mr Timamy belongs to a political affiliate of Mr Kenyatta's governing Jubilee coalition.He will remain in police custody until 30 June, while investigations continue.The attacks earlier in June killed at least 60 people, as gunmen descended on hotels and a police station.It was the most deadly attack in Kenya since last September, when at least 67 people were killed by al-Shabab fighters at Nairobi's Westgate shopping centre.Analysis: Emmanuel Igunza, BBC News, MombasaGovernor Timamy is a high-profile politician, so the case has attracted much interest.Senior politicians from the coastal region accompanied him to court while supporters thronged the court precincts in a show of solidarity.The charges levelled against Mr Timamy are perhaps an indication of how serious the government wants to stick to its line - that local politics were behind the killings.But it is not clear why a politician affiliated to the ruling coalition would be the first target of arrests.Most of the people killed in the attacks were ethnic Kikuyus. Mr Timamy is an ethnic Bajuni, an indigenous group from Lamu County. Many of the native communities have had long-standing differences with members of the Kikuyu community, who they say came to the area and \"took over their land\".But whether this is a simmering dispute over land, or a terror attack by al-Shabab, this case will be a defining moment in the fight against terrorism in Kenya - and the fragile relationship of the communities in the area.Five people were killed in another attack on Tuesday by an armed gang on the village of Witu, about 15km (9 miles) from Mpeketoni.The following day the authorities said they had arrested 13 alleged separatists accused of planning more attacks on the coast.Lamu island is a well-known tourist resort. However, the attacks happened on the mainland, in Lamu County.Correspondents say there are long-standing political and ethnic divisions in the area around Mpeketoni, as well as disagreements over land ownership.Land disputes were behind much of the ethnic violence which broke out across Kenya after the disputed 2007 elections."

Southern Africa is experiencing prolonged dry weather amid worries over the survival of crops and cattle. \"Severe droughts and devastating flooding being experienced throughout the tropics and sub-tropical zones bear the hallmarks of this El Niño, which is the strongest in more than 15 years,\" said WMO secretary-general Michel Jarraud.The authorities in California are expecting that El Niño will bring extremely wet conditions to the state in the early part of 2016.

Our planet has altered dramatically because of climate change, the general trend towards a warmer global ocean, the loss of Arctic sea ice and of over a million square km of summer snow cover in the northern hemisphere,\" said Mr Jarraud. \"So this naturally occurring El Niño event and human induced climate change may interact and modify each other in ways which we have never before experienced,\" he said. \"Even before the onset of El Niño, global average surface temperatures had reached new records.

Taxis, delivery vehicles, buses and emergency vehicles are still allowed.Initially some drivers complained that the move was not well publicised and claimed the signs warning of the bus gate were inadequate.Some also wrongly assumed that the gate was a temporary measure during the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games.If a motorist issued with a notice pays up within 14 days, they are charged £30 - and most do pay up within a fortnight. If they pay up later, they are charged £60.Councils across Scotland are adamant bus gates are only put in place to help the environment and public transport, and strongly deny claims from opponents that they are a source of revenue.Even the £1.3m from Nelson Mandela Place is still a drop in the ocean compared to Glasgow City Council's annual budget of more than £2bn.In July and August last year, 30,000 notices were issued to motorists.The number then fell substantially in September to 5,000 and has gradually declined since.Approximately 10,000 notices were served between April and July this year - 2,334 of them last month.

The settlement, the prime minister said, gave Britain the \"best of worlds\" and that was \"something worth fighting for\".So yes, Mr Cameron may have to spend the next two weeks twisting arms in Europe, there may be no guarantee of a deal and everyone is agreed that nothing is agreed until everything agreed.But the prime minister is already in campaign mode, bouncing around tiggerishly in his shirtsleeves, selling his deal almost as if it had been agreed.There will be an emergency brake on in-work benefits imposed on EU migrants, they will be able to send less child benefit home, there will be greater protection for businesses from the Eurozone, parliaments will get more powers to block EU laws, the UK will escape further political integration within the EU, there are legally binding promises to make the EU more competitive.And there will be changes to make it easier for the UK to exclude terror suspects even if there is no imminent threat.So here's the point.

Tory ministers who want to support the campaign to leave the EU are champing at the bit, silenced by collective responsibility while the prime minister gets his campaign rolling.They will be released from their omerta once the cabinet has agreed the government's official position after the summit later this month.But that means the PM has a clear couple of weeks where he can own the political space - as long as his ministers behave.It also illustrates Mr Cameron's impatience for a quick referendum in June while his opponents are divided and before refugee numbers have reached their summer peak.So Mr Cameron insists that what he wants is the right deal not a quick deal.But today he gave every impression of being a man in a hurry, keen to start campaigning even while he's still negotiating.In other words, the referendum campaign has begun."

Because when Network Rail first did their sums, it was based on guesswork.

Last month, 10 people were arrested there for trying to smuggle more than the allowed amount into mainland China.Danone said it was taking action to respond to the shortfall in the UK, including increasing production of milk, which means extra supplies of all its brands are arriving every week, according to BBC business correspondent Emma Simpson.Danone is also increasing production and supplies of its brands that are already available in China, in order to meet demand there.But it added: \"If parents are unable to find their baby's usual brand of milk, we recommend they try another local store or revisit the store on another occasion. \"Richard Dodd, head of media and campaigns at the British Retail Consortium, said: \"A number of retailers are limiting the amount of baby milk that can be bought by any one customer. \"Retailers are taking this precautionary step to ensure stocks continue to be available to everyone wanting baby milk,\" he added.However, Nestle insisted there were no shortages of its formula milk available to retailers.The company said: \"We do not have any evidence of bulk purchase of SMA for export, and we are in the process of contacting all our retail customers to confirm this, and to notify them that we do not have - and do not anticipate - any stock issues for powdered infant milks.We would like to reassure our consumers that we are not seeking to impose any limits on the sale of our formula, and any decision to do so is at the sole discretion of the retailer. Contrary to reports, Nestle UK has never requested that retailers limit the supply of SMA powdered infant milks sold to consumers.\""

        "text": "\"The challenge is to explain the origin of the volatile elements like carbon that remain outside the core in the mantle portion of our planet,\" said Rajdeep Dasgupta, a co-author of the study from Rice University in Houston, Texas.According to a widely accepted idea called the Late Veneer Hypothesis, Earth formed from material that was largely devoid of volatiles. These elements, such as carbon, sulphur, nitrogen and hydrogen, were added later on by space rocks after Earth's core had finished forming. \"Any of those elements that fell to Earth in meteorites and comets more than about 100 million years after the Solar System formed could have avoided the intense heat of the magma ocean that covered Earth up to that point,\" said Yuan Li, from the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. \"The problem with that idea is that while it can account for the abundance of many of these elements, there are no known meteorites that would produce the ratio of volatile elements in the silicate portion of our planet. \"The group had previously published papers showing that if even if carbon had not vaporised into space when the planet was largely molten, it would have ended up in the metallic core of our planet - because the iron-rich alloys there have a strong affinity for carbon.But if this is the case, where did the carbon in the mantle and biosphere come from?The team used laboratory experiments that can recreate the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions that exist deep inside Earth and other rocky planets.The found that one scenario that could reconcile the discrepancies in the carbon-to-sulphur ratio and carbon abundance was an embryonic planet like Mercury colliding with and being absorbed by Earth, early in its history. \"Because it's a massive body, the dynamics could work in a way that the core of that planet would go directly to the core of our planet, and the carbon-rich mantle would mix with Earth's mantle,\" said Dr Dasgupta."

        "text": "\"The mere fact that the US President stood in support of Mubarak suggests very strongly that that even the highest level analysis suggested that Mubarak was going to stay there,\" he told BBC News. \"That is likely because you have these area experts who have been studying Egypt for 30 years, and in 30 years nothing has happened to Mubarak.The Egypt graph, said Mr Leetaru, suggested that something unprecedented was happening this time. \"If you look at this tonal curve it would tell you the world is darkening so fast and so strongly against him that it doesn't seem possible he could survive. \"Similar drops were seen ahead of the revolution in Libya and the Balkans conflicts of the 1990s.Saudi Arabia, which has thus far resisted a popular uprising, had experienced fluctuations, but not to the same extent as some other states where leaders were eventually overthrown.In his report, Mr Leetaru suggests that analysis of global media reports about Osama Bin Laden would have yielded important clues about his location.While many believed the al-Qaeda leader to be hiding in Afghanistan, geographic information extracted from media reports consistently identified him with Northern Pakistan.Only one report mentioned the town of Abbottabad prior to Bin Laden's discovery by US forces in April 2011.However, the geo-analysis narrowed him down to within 200km, said Mr Leetaru.The computer event analysis model appears to give forewarning of major events, based on deteriorating sentiment.However, in the case of this study, its analysis is applied to things that have already happened.According to Kalev Leetaru, such a system could easily be adapted to work in real time, giving an element of foresight. \"That's the next stage,\" said Mr Leetaru, who is already working on developing the technology. \"It looks like a stock ticker in many regards and you know what direction it has been heading the last few minutes and you want to know where it is heading in the next few. \"It is very similar to what economic forecasting algorithms do. \"Mr Leetaru said he also hoped to improve the resolution of analysis, especially in relation to geographic location. \"The next iteration is going to city level and beyond and looking at individual groups and how they interact. \"I liken it to weather forecasting. It's never perfect, but we do better than random guessing.\""

Mr Rouhani, 68, signed a nuclear deal between Iran, the US and other countries in 2015.International sanctions were lifted as a result, but average Iranians say they do not feel the economic benefits in their daily lives.While oil exports have rebounded and inflation is back at single-digits, unemployment remains high, especially among the young people.Iran's hardliners had pulled all the stops and mobilised all their resources to bring out as many people as possible to grab the last centre of power in Iran that was not under their control, namely the executive branch.Sensing an effort by the hardliners, supporters of President Rouhani who back his promises to steer the country toward moderation came out in big numbers too. Turnout has been unprecedented. In Tehran, five million people turned out to vote - twice as many as in 2013.This was a revenge of the people against the hardliners who intimidated them, jailed them, executed them, drove them to exile, pushed them out of their jobs, and discriminated against women.President Rouhani will now have a bigger mandate to push through his reforms, to put an end to extremism, to build bridges with the outside world, to put the economy back on track.Iranians have said a resounding Yes to President Rouhani who, in recent years and particularly during the last several weeks of campaigning, promised to expand individual and political freedoms and make all those centres of power, like the Revolutionary Guard, accountable.He also promised a moderate vision and an outward-looking Iran and, at rallies, openly attacked the conservative-dominated judiciary and security services.Another challenge, experts say, will come from abroad, and the relations with the new US government. President Donald Trump opposes the nuclear deal which eased sanctions on the Middle Eastern country, but his White House renewed it earlier this week."

There are already concerns about a lack of hydrogen filling stations.And an equally big challenge will be producing them cheaply enough to keep them affordable for buyers.None of the carmakers has officially revealed the prices as yet, though some reports indicate that Toyota's FCV may cost between $50,000 and $100,000 (Â£31,000 to Â£62,000).The South Korean company has announced plans to start commercial sales of a fuel cell-powered version of its sports utility vehicle, the Tucson, in the US market.Honda Motor is also expected to unveil its latest concept version of a fuel cell-powered vehicle later this week.Many carmakers have been looking to develop the fuel cell technology further and bring it to mass production.One of the main reasons is that it is emission-free.The technology uses hydrogen to generate electricity to power the engine and the waste products are heat and water.At the same time, fuel cells charge much faster and travel a longer distance after being charged, compared with battery-operated electric cars.However, there are concerns over the demand for such vehicles, not least because there are not enough hydrogen filling stations.Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Nissan, said that worries over infrastructure were the key reason for his firm to put some of their plans on hold. \"Frankly, I don't know how they are going to do it, because knowing all the problems we have, to have a charging system with electricity, where is the hydrogen infrastructure?\" Mr Ghosn was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency. \"That's why we have postponed, in a certain way, some of our ambitions in terms of fuel cells.\""

Between the beginning of August and the end of February, the pound actually fell about 11% against the US dollar and 10% against the euro.How much of this was due to the referendum and how much was down to other factors?Well, the referendum date was not confirmed until 20 February, but it was widely expected to be announced.There was a pretty sharp fall in the value of the pound around the time of the announcement, as you can see from the graphs, although that particular dip was relatively short-lived.So, how much of the pound's fall was down to uncertainty surrounding a potential Brexit as opposed to factors such as interest rate expectations?As we have discussed before, predicting uncertainty cannot be seen as a controversial forecast, and it is generally accepted markets do not like uncertainty.So it is fair to say some of the fall in the pound has been due to the potential for Brexit - it is a factor that has been cited regularly in analysts' reports. The Office for Budget Responsibility cited some of the banks predicting weakness for the pound.But given the result of the referendum will have implications for the economy for decades to come, a bit of weakness in the pound ahead of the vote should not be seen as too worrying a factor.In particular, a weak pound is not a bad thing for everyone - it is good news for many exporters in the UK.Reality Check verdict: The referendum debate is likely to be one of the factors weakening the pound, but things like delayed interest rate rises are also responsible.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"

I am only reading things in the media. \"If you have a good Six Nations and a good summer tour [to New Zealand], then you are in contention. \"That is something I will think about later down the line.\""

We hope from the recommendations made this never happens again. \"We fought the hardest battle to get answers, knowing we had already lost William. \"Sepsis: Why can it be so hard to spot?Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was a \"tragic case\"  and apologised for the \"serious failings\".He said: \"The recommendations are far far-reaching with national implications. \"When you look at the totality of what the Mead family suffered, there is a confusion in the public mind which the NHS needs to address. \"The issue is that there are too many choices and you can't always get through quickly to the help you need.

But expenditure has not kept up with a growing state prison population, which saw a rise of 343% between 1980 and 2013, although it has now declined slightly.Mr Gibson-Light said staff and inmates at the prison he visited said the amount of food being provided had decreased steadily over decades and warned the shift could have serious implications. \"Prisoners are so unhappy with the quality and quantity of prison food that they receive that they have begun relying on ramen noodles - a cheap, durable food product - as a form of money in the underground economy,\" he said. \"The form of money is not something that changes often or easily, even in the prison underground economy; it takes a major issue or shock to initiate such a change,\" he added.He called for more research into what the reduction in food could mean for the care of prisoners."

The changes will only apply to new backless seats and not ones already on the market that meet current safety standards.Parents can continue to use their current model after the rule change and will not need to buy a new one.It will be down to manufacturers of new seats to ensure they meet the revised safety standards and are labelled correctly.Children must use a child car seat until they are 12 years old or 135cm (4ft 5in) tall, whichever comes first.There are typically three types of children's car seats:Only EU-approved child car seats can be used in the UK - which have a label showing a capital \"E\" in a circle.Parents should typically choose a car seat based on their child's height or weight.A driver can be fined up to Â£500 if a child under 14 does not wear a seat belt or child restraint. Anyone 14 and over not wearing a seat belt must pay the fine themselves.There are exceptions. For example, children can travel without a child car seat in a taxi or minicab if they travel on a rear seat and wear an adult seat belt if they are aged three or older or without a seat belt if they are under three.Many parents think they can judge which car seat they need to buy based on their child's age but it should only be used as guidance.Car seats are typically categorised according to height and weight.Height-based car seats, known as \"i-Size\" seats, must be rear-facing until the child is over 15 months old.For weight-based car seats, the type depends on how heavy a child is.A more detailed list is available through childcarseats.org.uk"

The forward hurried his finish, though, and scuffed the ball wide.It became a galling miss for Rangers, because minutes later a hopeful Gavin Gunning header sent Armstrong clear.Nadir Ciftci was returning from an offside position but was deemed not to be interfering with play and Armstrong took advantage of the confusion to clip a shot past Simonsen that kissed a post before nestling in the net.A pattern was established, since Rangers had the better patches of play, but could not influence the outcome.When Fraser Aird was free in the area, he laid the ball back to Jon Daly, only for the striker to direct a shot rashly over the bar.Moments later, Richard Foster failed to clear his lines and allowed Ryan Gauld to burrow into the Rangers penalty area before shunting into the path of Armstrong. He could not connect cleanly and neither, subsequently, could Mackay-Steven, but the ball looped off Bilel Mohsni, over Simonsen, and into the net.Smith restored some hope for Rangers with a free-kick that squeezed between Radoslaw Cierzniak and the base of his left-hand post.That goal came just before half-time and, athough Rangers continued to enjoy greater possession after the interval, their frailties could not be disguised.Mohsni was often hapless in possession, attacks were intermittent and haphazard in nature, and there was not enough link-up play between the midfield and the forwards.United's midfield struggled to retain possession, and their defence often sat too deep, but their four front players were a constant threat, not least because of the calamities that the Rangers defence were capable of.When Foster broke up one move and passed back to Simonsen, the goalkeeper hesitated before stubbing the ball straight at Ciftci. The striker rounded the stricken goalkeeper and was celebrating even before he rolled the ball into the empty net.Rangers restored something of their reputation with this display, but United were the more clinical side."

        "text": "With a heavy heart he abandoned the forces, shelved his accountancy plans and began to ply his trade as a cricketer.Graveney scored more than 1,500 runs in his second and third seasons with the county and was handed a Test debut against South Africa at Old Trafford in 1951.He scored 175 against India in his second Test but only mustered one further hundred in the following six years as his inconsistent form saw him frequently left out of the side.Graveney played some of his finest cricket after joining Worcestershire in 1961, becoming the first player since World War II to reach a century of centuries in 1964 when he scurried a single off Northamptonshire's David Larter following an uncharacteristically mistimed pull shot.His prolific form for the county prompted an England recall in the summer of 1966, which he fully justified with 459 runs at 76.50 in four Tests against the touring West Indians.Graveney's international career ended on a sour note when he was suspended for three Tests as punishment for playing a benefit game on the rest day of the first Test against the Windies in 1969, and was never picked again.He retired from county cricket in 1970 but spent two further seasons playing and coaching Queensland in Australian first-class cricket.Graveney became a pub landlord in retirement, worked as a cricket pundit for BBC television and continued to play golf off a handicap of one.He was president of the MCC from 2004-2005 and four years later was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. At the time of his death he was one of only 25 men in the history of cricket to reach a hundred hundreds.Graveney's nephew David followed his father and uncle in captaining Gloucestershire, and was England's chairman of selectors during their 2005 Ashes success."

He added his next move would be a \"big one\". \"This is very good news,\" he said in a statement obtained by celebrity website TMZ.Production on Two and a Half Men was officially halted in late February after the 45-year-old actor insulted Chuck Lorre, the show's producer and co-creator, in several interviews.The actor had a contract with Warner Bros that ran to the end of the 2012 television season, providing him with $2m (Â£1.2m) per episode.Sheen said last week he was being paid too little and demanded an increase to $3m per show.Over the past few weeks, Sheen has given a series of often angry, rambling media interviews. He insists he is drug-free after undergoing rehabilitation in January.The actor was taken to hospital in Los Angeles in January with severe abdominal pains before entering rehab.He filed for divorce from his third wife, Brooke Mueller, in November, citing irreconcilable differences.Meanwhile, Sheen posted a message on the micro-blogging website Twitter early on Monday, searching for an intern to assist him in his work.The tweet, posted prior to Warner Bros's announcement, was a paid-for endorsement from the website Internships.com. \"I'm looking to hire a winning INTERN with TigerBlood,\" Sheen's message said.The actor has used social media websites to comment on the dispute between himself and the show's producers.It took him roughly 24 hours to reach 1 million followers on Twitter - a record for the website."

But the signal this sends, bringing two of the world's biggest economic powers together, is unmistakeable.EU-Japan negotiations began in 2012 then stalled. It was Donald Trump's election, and the inward turn America is taking, that spurred the EU and Japan to overcome their differences. Both want to show domestic audiences they can deliver signature deals that promise new economic opportunities.They also want to send a clear message internationally that the EU and Japan, highly-developed democracies, remain committed to a liberal, free-trading, rules-based world, and they will seek to shape it even if the US won't.The outline plan was signed in Brussels after a meeting between the Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, and the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, on the eve of a meeting of the G20 group of leading economies in Hamburg.It comes hard on the heels of the collapse of a long-awaited trade agreement between Japan, the US and other Pacific ring countries, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was scrapped in January by US President Donald Trump.The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the agreement showed the EU's commitment to world trade: \"We did it. We concluded EU-Japan political and trade talks. EU is more and more engaged globally. \"Mr Tusk also said the deal countered the argument put forward by some of those in favour of Brexit that the EU was unable to promote free trade: \"Although some are saying that the time of isolationism and disintegration is coming again, we are demonstrating that this is not the case. \"He added that the deal was not just about common trade interests, but reflected \"the shared values that underpin our societies, by which I mean liberal democracy, human rights and the rule of law\".Japan is the world's third-largest economy, with a population of about 127 million.As it stands, the country is Europe's seventh biggest export market.One of the most important trade categories for the EU is dairy goods.Japan's appetite for milk and milk-based products has been growing steadily in recent years.The EU's dairy farmers are struggling with falling demand in its home nations and an ultra-competitive buying climate, which farmers say means they are paid less than the cost of production.Even once the agreement is fully signed, the deal is likely to have in place long transition clauses of up to 15 years to allow sectors in both countries time to adjust to the new outside competition."

        "text": "If intensive care units, for example, are full then there are no available beds there for patients who need them to recover from serious scheduled operations.If that is the case -  some elective surgery will inevitably get postponed.Late last year, the Welsh Government pledged an extra Â£45m to health boards to try make sure scheduled, elective surgery and treatments are  more protected this winter.NHS Wales chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall said it was still too early to tell in terms of numbers but hospitals needed to ensure elective surgery was managed in a \"sensible manner\" as there was a duty to patients.Another interesting thing to note - sometimes the figures show that unscheduled care units actually see a greater number of patients during the summer months - due to trips, slips, falls, bumps and so on.But in winter the NHS often has to deal with more severely-ill patients, for example elderly patients who have breathing problems.These need much more care, spend more time in the system and need more support to get better.COMPARING WALES WITH ENGLANDHistorically A&E waits have been longer in Wales than in England. Some experts argue that is because there is a bigger mismatch in Wales between the number of beds available and the demand for them.The difference might also reflect demographic factors -  for example the Welsh population as a whole being older sicker and less well-off than other parts of the UK.It is not straightforward comparing Wales with the NHS in England, because the \"clock\" starts differently when patients arrive.For those in Wales, the waiting time starts being recorded as soon as the patient is registered inside the A&E department - or when the ambulance crew notifies the desk they have arrived outside.In England, the arrival time starts when the patient is handed over or 15 minutes after the ambulance arrives at A&E, whichever is earlier.Leaked data for NHS England seen by BBC News shows the figure reached a low of 75.8% on 3 January but had recovered to 82.4% last week.HOW DO DIFFERENT HOSPITALS COMPARE?ARE THINGS GETTING MORE DIFFICULT?Looking back at A&E waiting times statistics in Wales over recent years - what is clear is that in each successive year things appear to be getting ever more difficult - despite the Welsh Government ploughing more money each year to help health boards deliver they're winter plans.What is not in doubt though is staff on the front line are trying hard to make sure patients get treated safely - even when the pressure is really on.The problem is the pressures year on year show little sign of easing."

You get, essentially, one of Zion's most massive cliffs collapsing, running across the canyon in 20 seconds with peak velocities of 90 metres per second (200mph),\" said Dr Moore.It is still not clear from the investigations what caused the rock avalanche. There is insufficient data on palaeo-earthquakes in the area to make a statement about a seismic trigger. It remains a possibility, but so too does a simple internal failure of the rock.And while there is evidence for other rock avalanches in the canyon, Dr Moore says a repeat event is not something the National Parks Service nor tourists should be unduly worried about.Just marvel at the spectacle, he urges. \"People when they go there, they look up to the huge Navajo sandstone cliffs, and I think it's a little more subtle to look down at our feet and wonder why this canyon is so accessible, why the valley floor is so flat? \"Studying landslides for my job, the story I tell is often connected to a lot of gloom and doom.

The latest version of Android is known as Marshmallow.In a statement, Google said: \"\"We've long been aware of this evolving family of malware and we're constantly improving our systems that detect it. We actively block installations of infected apps to keep users and their information safe. \"Google released the latest security update for Android this month and it tackled more than 108 separate vulnerabilities in the operating system. So far this year, security updates for Android have closed more than 270 bugs."

It's available.

Scientists say it is likely that you can now make sense of it.It is the brain's ability to fill in the blanks that could help explain why some people suffer from hallucinations.One of the study's authors, Dr Christoph Teufel, from Cardiff University, said: \"Vision is a constructive process - in other words, our brain makes up the world that we 'see'. \"It fills in the blanks, ignoring the things that don't quite fit, and presents to us an image of the world that has been edited and made to fit with what we expect. \"An example of this would be a person walking into their living room and identifying a fast-moving black shape as their cat, despite the fact the visual information was no more than a blur.The sensory input was minimal and prior knowledge did the creative work.Prof Paul Fletcher of the University of Cambridge said: \"Having a predictive brain is very useful - it makes us efficient and adept at creating a coherent picture of an ambiguous and complex world. \"But it also means that we are not very far away from perceiving things that aren't actually there, which is the definition of a hallucination. \"He added that \"altered perceptual experiences\" are not limited to people with mental illnesses, but have been seen in a milder form across the whole population."

He must act to protect this important British industry. \"Labour's amendment, expected to come to a vote on Tuesday, has won the support of a dozen Tories who are unhappy about EU control over UK tax rates and seeking to highlight the issue in the run-up to June's EU referendum.Those backing it include former ministers Tim Loughton and Peter Lilley and Graham Brady, chair of the influential 1922 committee of backbench Conservatives - all of whom want the UK to leave the EU.Paul Scully, the MP for Sutton and Cheam who is backing EU exit, told the BBC's Daily Politics the situation was \"absolutely outrageous\" and he was \"seriously considering\" voting with Labour. \"At the end of the day this should be a UK-made decision,\" he said. \"You have a situation where we can look at a sugar tax, where we penalising people for doing something the government does not believe is right, but we can't reward the government for doing something we think is the right thing to do. \"If the SNP and the Lib Dems also support the amendment, the government could be at risk of defeat as it only has a working majority of 17 in the House of Commons."

Taggart's ratings within the STV region remained strong.But when the series was shown on the network a few months later, it was a different story. Taggart's ratings across the UK fell to 3.8 million for the most recent series - considered poor for a mainstream drama.In recent years, ITV has axed a number of long-running dramas - notably Heartbeat and The Bill - to put more effort into bringing new shows to the screen.Although Taggart had lost its popularity on ITV1, it remains popular in Scotland and is important to STV commercially and the television industry in Scotland.For instance, STV generates money from Taggart through sales to foreign broadcasters - over the years it has been screened in many countries around the world.Distributor DRG said Taggart was a \"hugely popular\" series internationally, airing across three different TV channels in Australia alone.A DRG spokesperson added: \"It's our shared ambition to return Taggart to UK screens and we can confirm we're currently working closely with STV as we explore options to achieve this. \"ITV did recently commission another drama from STV - a 90-minute one-off called Fast Freddie, The Widow and Me, which is expected to be shown over Christmas.STV and ITV recently ended a long-running legal dispute amicably. The dispute was triggered by STV's decision to drop a number of ITV network programmes but touched on many other matters.ITV sources are stressing the decision to discontinue Taggart was a purely creative decision, completely unconnected with the dispute."

Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark have worked tirelessly since silver in London 2012. \"They have eliminated all of their weaknesses and it has all come together here in Rio. \"I don't think we saw the best of Mills and Clark today but they won't care about that and I don't care about that. \"Britain have been the most successful nation in sailing in three of the past four Olympics.The only exception was London 2012, when Sir Ben Ainslie's fourth career Olympic title was his country's only gold of the Games.Ainslie's Finn class is one area Britain have dominated in recent times, with his three golds in successive Games sandwiched between Scott in Rio and Iain Percy at Sydney 2000.Mills and Clark's success takes Britain to the top of the Rio sailing medal list, by virtue of Nick Dempsey's silver in the windsurfing, with the Netherlands also winning two golds.It also means Britain have won 12 Olympic sailing gold medals in the past four Games.Media playback is not supported on this deviceSubscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox."

This means continued investment in new and longer trains to meet existing demand. \"Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group - which represents train operators - said firms were prepared to work with the government over the issue. \"We understand passengers' frustration when they can't get a seat which is why rail companies are working together to invest and improve journeys with thousands of new carriages and 6,400 extra train services a week by 2021,\" he said. \"We will continue to work with governments to increase seats on key routes to boost communities, businesses and the economy.\""

However its review of whether he received a fair trial has been in limbo because the British courts won't disclose the secret material.In a unanimous judgement on Wednesday, a Supreme Court panel of seven judges backed that decision - saying English courts could block disclosure on national security grounds, even if the material was at the heart of an appeal.Lord Mance, the lead judge on the panel of seven, said: \"The appellant has not made good the proposition which he needs to establish, namely that there are no circumstances in which refusal to permit disclosure of the in-camera [secret] material to the European Court of Human Rights in the appellant's response could be justified. \"Under the international rules governing the European Court, each state promises not to stand in the way of anyone who wants to seek its help.But the Supreme Court said the long-established block on revealing national security material did not compromise that principle.

This method relies on staring at these suns, hoping to catch an object passing in front. When such a \"transit\" occurs, there is a tell-tale decrease in starlight.The US space agency's Kepler telescope has identified more than a thousand planets this way.If intelligent civilisations are out there, it is safe to assume they too will be looking for other worlds - like ours - using the same idea, believe Kipping and Teachey.According to the pair's calculations, emitting a continuous 30-megawatt laser for about 10 hours, once a year, would be enough to distort the characteristic dip in light when Earth transited the Sun, as viewed from an alien Kepler telescope. \"It doesn't have to be one huge laser; it could be an array positioned around the Earth. Or you could put it in space as a satellite, and we've calculated that the International Space Station already collects exactly the amount of energy we would need,\" Prof Kipping told BBC News.This is true for a laser system working in visible light. Prof Kipping concedes, however, that a laser cloak that covers all wavelengths, not just the visible colours, would need a very large array of tuneable lasers with a total power of 250MW.But an alternative might be to use a laser simply to disguise the interesting aspects about Earth - features in its atmosphere that betray the fact that life exists here. These are a suite of gases that include oxygen, ozone and methane. \"If we just cloaked out those biosignatures then another civilisation might detect our planet through a transit, everything would add up, but Earth would appear as a dead world and they'd soon lose interest,\" Prof Kipping added.The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (Seti) is the collective term used to describe positive efforts to detect and contact alien life. A number of experiments are currently under way that are trying to see if aliens are actually signalling us with lasers.But just as with the attempts to detect the radio transmissions from aliens, this \"optical Seti\" approach, as it is known, has also found nothing of interest among the starsâ€¦ yet."

        "text": "And particularly not stoats. \"And the stoats are an incredibly efficient predator. Literally, where there are stoats, New Zealand native birds do not prosper. \"And, in particular, they are really bad news for our native kiwi bird. So, where stoats are present, very few juveniles get to one year of age. In fact, probably, we lose 90% of individuals. \"In New Zealand there has been a huge campaign to trap and poison stoats. And that's sometimes been controversial, because poison is applied - albeit in a targeted fashion - by helicopter.So the hope is that once the population has been reduced you could then - counter-intuitively - introduce more stoats. But they would be secret agents with genetic modifications.For example, they may be engineered only to have male offspring and to pass that characteristic on to their progeny.So, over time, it would be harder and harder for the population to reproduce itself.Releasing genetically-engineered creatures that can't breed into the landscape - that sounds familiar. Ah, yes. It's the plot of the Jurassic Park movies. And if they've taught us anything, it is that life will find a way.I was worried Prof Gemmell might laugh at the idea. But, in fact, he took it seriously. \"Nature will find a way\", he agreed. \"And the way is normally mutation. And that was exactly what happened in Jurassic Park. \"But, he said, scientists can do a couple of things to counter-act that. \"You can put in back-up systems to make sure that the gene drive keeps working. And then, you have to go out and monitor things. You can't just walk away from it. You have to keep an eye on what's happening in the population.And he says there may be other factors that make such a scheme more difficult than expected. \"For example, what happens if female stoats don't find the male stoats that carry the damaged genes attractive, and don't want to mate with them? \"That would be a problem. And will these stoats, that have been bred in the laboratory, survive in the wild? \"So there's a fair bit we need to figure out first before we get to a point where we actually have genetically-modified stoats to deploy either in New Zealand or in Orkney,\" said Prof Gemmell."

Mercedes eventually called him in to retire with five laps to go.The incident between the Mercedes drivers played into the hands of Red Bull, who had been expected to struggle on this track because of their Renault engine's power deficit to the Mercedes.The team tried to neutralise that by running a smaller rear wing than their rivals, relying on the car's standard-setting under-body downforce for grip.When Vettel ran wide at the fast Pouhon left-hander on lap five - his second driving error in as many races - Ricciardo swooped past to move into second and put the pressure on Rosberg.Rosberg made his first pit stop early, after just eight laps, because of the extra wear his loss of front downforce was causing his tyres and the time lost allowed Ricciardo into the lead.The Australian drove superbly to build a lead for himself and seemed set for a comfortable win before Rosberg's late stop, with 10 laps to go, raised the possibility of the German catching him.The stop dropped Rosberg to 20 seconds behind Ricciardo but he soon began closing at more than two seconds a lap. However, the Red Bull had enough to hold him off for his third victory of an increasingly impressive first season with a front-running team.Bottas drove a measured race to pass Raikkonen for third in the closing laps, as the Ferrari driver finally found some of the form he has been lacking all season.Raikkonen made ground with an early pit stop and ran in the top three most of the race before losing out to Bottas with eight laps to go.In the second Ferrari, Fernando Alonso found himself having to fight back after being forced to serve a five-second penalty at his first pit stop.That dropped him into a fight with the McLaren of Kevin Magnussen, who proved very difficult to pass as a result of the greater power of his Mercedes engine.Magnussen's delaying of Alonso brought Vettel and Button on to their tail, and the Ferrari lost out, its front wing damaged on the back of Vettel's car, in a no-holds-barred four-way fight in the closing laps.Alonso ended up eighth, behind Vettel, Magnussen and Button.Magnussen was later handed a 20-second penalty and two driver penalty points for crowding Alonso off the circuit during the battle, which promoted Force India's Nico Hulkenberg to 10th, behind team-mate Sergio Perez and Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat.Full race resultsBelgian Grand Prix coverage details"

The relationship with ITV went badly wrong for a while. Woodward gambled on refusing to take expensive ITV drama, and had to admit defeat.The demise of police drama Taggart as a money-earner has yet to be replaced. The drive towards becoming an independent producer for other channels has been bumpy and fallen short of expectations.But STV has survived, and is in fairly robust health - the only part of the channel 3 network that is independent of ITV.It has refocused on its online news and entertainment, learning quickly that the plan to go hyper-local with hundreds of parish pump news sites was not going to work, and changing tack.Its video-on-demand is growing by 23% in the first five months of this year.Scotland Tonight has been a notable success, seeing off its BBC rival in the same time slot.And Woodward has taken the opportunity of new licences for local TV, deftly turning them from city stations into a new national network, and beating the BBC to an integrated TV news programme.STV2, launched on Monday, may not be quite the spirit intended when the licences were handed out. It may not have much of a budget. But so far, it's been proving a smarter business than others who won the right to give local TV a try.Ten years is often seen as an appropriate time for a chief executive to move on, for reasons of good governance.But one other reason why Mr Woodward may be thinking of getting out of his Clydeside office is the appearance among his shareholders of an investment fund called Crystal Amber.It has just raised its stake to 14% of STV shares. That's in addition to 21% of shares in Johnston Press.Why? Richard Bernstein, who runs the fund from London and Guernsey, isn't saying. But Crystal Amber is an activist investor.As Ashley Highfield is finding at Johnston Press in Edinburgh, its interest in a stock may help support the price, but it can also be a warning of turbulence ahead."

The company is appealing against the decision.Ministers recently announced plans to fast-track fracking applications, saying they could take over the power to decide if councils repeatedly take longer than the 16-week statutory timeframe to evaluate plans."

Tunisia's beaches were a top destination for European tourists.But unemployment among a swelling population of young people remained high, and large sections of the Tunisian interior remained poor.In the style of many Arab rulers, Ben Ali's face became a constant presence in Tunisia, with giant posters of the president visible in public spaces across the country.Political protest was not tolerated and human rights groups accused Ben Ali's regime of unfairly arresting and mistreating political dissidents.Under the surface, there was resentment against the perceived corruption surrounding the ruling elite, some of which was detailed in US diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks at the end of 2010.Ben Ali was married twice with six children. His second wife, Leila Trabelsi, played a prominent role in Tunisian public life and reportedly helped amass huge economic holdings for her extended family.With no obvious rivals to Ben Ali, there was speculation that he was looking to pass on power to one of his relatives.In the final days of 2010, a series of protests began in the centre of the country after a young graduate set himself on fire when stopped from selling fruit and vegetables without a licence.The protests, advertised widely through social media networks, gradually spread.Ben Ali initially blamed the demonstrations on a fringe of \"extremists\". But he changed tack on 13 January, expressing deep regrets for the deaths of protesters, pledging to introduce media freedoms, and promising not to stand in 2014.But his offer of concessions failed to quell the unrest, and the following day, after huge crowds took to the streets of Tunis and clashed with the security forces once again, he fled the country."

The weather was cold - the temperature was 4C - and it has been suggested that a lack of temperature in the tyres could well have been a contributing factor.F1 tyres have to be at the right temperature to operate effectively and the temperature in Maranello on Thursday was in the region of 10C cooler than F1 cars would ever normally encounter at even the coolest Grand Prix.The Pirelli spokesman also said that one of the technologies the company was trying that day were tyres that operate without the use of the heating blankets that have been used in F1 for many years to ensure they are at close to operating temperature as possible when they leave the pits.Pirelli has modified its wet-weather tyres for the 2017 season in response to widespread criticism from drivers of the 'extreme' tyre, which is used in the worst conditions.Vettel described the tyre at last year's British Grand Prix as \"basically just good enough to follow the safety car\", adding that \"no-one really has any trust in it\".The issue arose again following a number of crashes during the soaking race in Brazil in November.The problems have led to F1 giving Pirelli more test days to try out tyre developments. One of the eight pre-season test days in Barcelona at the end of this month and the beginning of March has been dedicated to this."

A defence witness has said Mr Zimmerman was in the process of starting a business.He also attended a citizen's police academy with the Seminole Sheriff's Office.A spokeswoman described the once-a-week scheme that totalled 14 hours as an educational tool to teach residents about police work, not a training programme.In 2005, Mr Zimmerman was arrested for shoving a state alcohol agency officer near a bar.The charge was later dropped when he agreed to fulfil a \"pre-trial diversion\" programme for first-time offenders, which usually involves fines and anger management classes.Shortly after, a girlfriend took out a restraining order, following an argument where each accused the other of being the aggressor.Mr Zimmerman possessed a concealed-carry permit for a 9mm handgun.As a neighbourhood watch volunteer, he had called Sanford's police department 46 times over the previous eight years. A friend told the court he had taught Mr Zimmerman firearm safety.According to neighbours, Mr Zimmerman organised the neighbourhood watch during a rash of burglaries in the community.One neighbour said the 29-year-old had caught a thief while patrolling the neighbourhood."

The wider it is the more money a bank makes.Co-op's is still a relatively modest 1.32%. That compares with Lloyds, which is expected to hit 2.6% by the end of the year.Generally, mortgages are a more profitable line of business for banks compared with savings products.And the mortgage market is brutally competitive at the moment, as the major banks battle for home buyers' custom.So interest rates charged to borrowers are under intense pressure to remain as low as possible.Which could be bad news for savers, if a bank wants to keep that margin improvement.Of course, this is all a balancing act. Depositors are important for a bank's capital position - so irritate them at your peril.Certainly, Mr Booker will be pleased that the Co-op has arrested the fall in current account holders.In the same period last year, Co-op lost over 60,000 customers.

He is a senior writer at Newsweek magazine, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair and a best-selling author of books including The Informant.Investigators found that Mr Rivello had sent messages to other Twitter users about Mr Eichenwald and a plan to attack him virtually, including one that read: \"I hope this sends him into a seizure\".Tweet 'caused' epileptic seizure\"Spammed this at [victim] let's see if he dies,\" another message read, according to the justice department.Investigators found a screenshot on his iCloud account of an altered Wikipedia page for Mr Eichenwald, falsely listing his date of death as 16 December, a day after the image was sent.He had also researched epilepsy seizure triggers on the epilepsy.com website.The Twitter message was no different from \"a bomb sent in the mail or anthrax sent in an envelope,\" Steven Lieberman, a lawyer for Mr Eichenwald, told the New York Times. \"It triggers a physical effect. \"Mr Rivello will have his case heard in Texas, where his alleged victim is based.The justice department did not say what motivated the attack, though reports have speculated that it may have been related to Mr Eichenwald's frequent criticism of US President Donald Trump on Twitter.Mr Eichenwald is reported to have suffered the effects of the seizure for several weeks. He tweeted on Friday that more than 40 people had sent him \"strobes\" after learning about the case.After the attack was reported in December, Stefano Seri, a professor of neurophysiology at Aston University in the UK, said the material in the tweet must have been carefully constructed. \"Abrupt changes in light intensity, or luminance, can trigger seizures. The most sensitive range is about 15-25 flashes per second,\" he said. \"The picture would need to occupy most of the visual field. It would take some very sick people to do this, but technically, it is possible. \"Modern LED screens are not as provocative as older ones. It takes a very carefully designed stimulus to induce a seizure,\" Prof Seri added."

While planning the bombing, they alleged, he presented himself as Sami Issa - the registered owner of three jewellery shops, an apartment in Jounieh and a motor boat, who said he was from a Christian village.Hezbollah has denied any involvement in the Hariri assassination.After Mughniyeh was killed in a car bombing in Damascus in 2008 - reportedly the result of a joint operation by Israel's Mossad spy agency and the US Central Intelligence Agency - Badreddine is believed to have taken over most of his duties as commander of Hezbollah's military wing.Badreddine was himself targeted for assassination in January 2015, when a suspected Israeli air strike in the Syrian Golan Heights killed six Hezbollah fighters, including Mughniyeh's son Jihad and an Iranian Revolutionary Guards general, the New York Times reported, citing an intelligence operative in the region. Badreddine had dropped out of the gathering at the last minute, it said.His death was initially blamed on Israel, Hezbollah's chief enemy.But Hezbollah later said its commander had been killed in a bombardment carried out by Sunni extremists.

        "text": "\"It is nerve-wracking,\" one said to me, perhaps euphemistically.Here is the ecstasy and agony of what could happen next week.If Greeks vote \"Yes\" to the deal with creditors - pension cuts, VAT rises and all - just maybe the European Central Bank (ECB), whose governing council meets on Monday morning, will lift the ceiling a fraction on the provision of Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA).That might not permit banks to start operating as normal with immediate effect. But it could allow the 60-euro daily ceiling on withdrawals to be raised a bit and the total freeze on transfers abroad to be eased somewhat.And that might allow the Greek economy to be taken out of the deep freeze it has been in since banks were ordered to more-or-less close last Monday.But if Greeks vote \"No\", as the government wishes them to do, there would be zero chance of the ECB turning on the ELA tap again.And as I said a few days ago, a \"No\" vote might persuade the ECB to demand additional collateral from banks to cover the risk of losses on the 120bn euros in emergency lending it and the Bank of Greece have already provided.This would be very painful for the banks. Right now they have unencumbered assets sufficient to borrow an additional 17bn to 20bn euros from the Bank of Greece, if the ELA ceiling were lifted.But if the ECB decided these assets - such as loans to Greek companies - are intrinsically less valuable than it currently thinks, and imposed a bigger so-called haircut on these loans, that 17bn to 20bn of possible additional credit could shrink to zero or a negative number.Or to put this more clearly, rather than lending to banks, the Bank of Greece and ECB could start to demand some of their outstanding credit back. Which none of the banks are in any position to give.Greek banks would go from their current frozen state to totally and utterly crippled. Which would dash any chance of them providing the fuel to re-start the Greek economy.And that would create a vicious cycle of more of the loans they've made to businesses and households going bad. Which in turn would wreak further damage on the banks.So there is a heavy responsibility both on Greek voters and then the European Central Bank over the next 48 hours. They will decide whether the Greek financial system and Greek economy stands or falls."

They wanted to preserve the Welsh language and culture.Benbow Phillips' settlement lasted four to five years. Dr Tudur said some settlers moved to a nearby thriving coal mining area to work.A lack of support by the Brazilian government was also another reason why the settlement did not prove successful.Benbow Phillips stayed in Brazil until 1872 before moving to Patagonia."

It is based on an outline agreement reached at a special EU summit on 13 July.The wide-ranging MoU sets deadlines for the many economic reforms required. At every stage the Greek government will have to consult closely with the lenders.The MoU recognises \"the need for social justice\", so that \"the burden of adjustment is borne by all parts of society\". However, it does not offer debt relief - despite Syriza's argument that Greece's crippling debts are unsustainable.There will be no discussion of debt relief until after the lenders' first review in October.The Greek government is required to achieve a primary budget surplus (a surplus minus interest payments) of 3.5% of GDP by 2018. The targets to reach that are: a 0.25% deficit this year, 0.5% surplus in 2016 and 1.75% surplus in 2017.Those targets are tough - but not as tough as originally envisaged, because the Greek economy is expected to shrink by 2.3% this year. It has spent most of the past seven years in recession.Greek economy returns to growthWhat about the banks?Greece's banks remain in a fragile state - they depend on emergency ECB funding and cannot borrow in capital markets.Strict capital controls remain in force - Greeks are limited to withdrawing €420 a week from their accounts.The banks were closed for three weeks in June-July, to prevent a bank run by anxious customers, who feared economic meltdown and \"Grexit\" - exit from the euro. The controls put a severe brake on economic activity.Under the new bailout terms, Greek banks are getting €10bn, aimed at recapitalising them by the end of the year."

It was Labour where they were uniformly wrong. They also overestimated UKIP and the SNP.Survation were closest to the actual result. Kantar Public's numbers were also reasonably good.YouGov's final poll, like most of the others, seriously underestimated Labour. Prior to that, they had been suggesting a closer race. They also had a separate seat projection model which had been indicating a hung parliament. That had been met with a lot of scepticism but, with hindsight, was pretty accurate.In the final weeks of the campaign, the polls were often criticised for being \"all over the place\". It's true that they were pointing to very different outcomes.That variation clearly made it difficult to interpret what they were saying. It's surely better, though, that they had different numbers than that they were all wrong in exactly the same way. If you're looking for consistent accuracy then opinion polls are probably not for you.Pollsters are also sometimes accused of herding - deliberately manipulating their figures so they all say the same thing. That accusation can't be levelled at this election.In 2015 the polls went wrong because their samples were not representative of the electorate - they contained too many Labour voters. They also failed to estimate the difference in turnout rates between different age groups - they overestimated turnout among young voters.The pollsters who were furthest from the actual result this time were those, like ICM and ComRes, who had taken the strongest measures to try to rectify the problem from 2015. Survation made no significant changes to their methodology and came out on top.It looks as though the errors this time were caused, at least in part, by fighting the last war.We'll never know the exact figures for turnout among young voters - it's a secret ballot remember - but YouGov's post-election estimate puts it at 57% for 18-19 year olds and 59% for 20-24 year olds.That's lower than for older voters but considerably higher than estimates for young voters in 2015.We can also see that the places where the number of voters increased the most were generally those with young populations. The assumption made by some pollsters that young turnout would continue to under-perform was probably wrong."

They also alleged the flat was redecorated free of charge and that he later nominated the interior designer for an honour.The jury found him guilty of misconduct over his failure to disclose the lease of the flat, but dismissed the charge related to the designer and did not reach a verdict on whether he accepted a bribe in the form of the refurbishment.A career civil servant, Tsang rose through the ranks to become Hong Kong's second chief executive, following Tung Chee-hwa.His deputy, former Chief Secretary Rafael Hui, was jailed for accepting bribes from a property tycoon in 2014."

The North's plutonium stocks are finite, but if it could enrich uranium it could build up a nuclear stockpile.Plutonium enrichment also has to happen in large, easy-to-spot facilities, whereas uranium enrichment can more easily be carried out in secrecy.The first indication was again report of an \"artificial quake\" in North Korea, registering about magnitude 5.1, close to Punggye-ri.North Korea later announced it had conducted its first successful test of a hydrogen bomb.H-bombs, also known as thermonuclear warheads, are massively more powerful than atomic bombs, using fusion - the merging of atoms - rather than fission to unleash enormous amounts of energy.Though again it has never been confirmed, that claim alarmed the international community.Observations from afar suggested the blast detected was not large enough to have been a full thermonuclear device, but may have involved some nuclear fusion.Again, North Korea said the device had been miniaturised.A few months later, Kim Jong-un announced that North Korea scientists had been able to do what had long been feared, and make a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on a warhead.It came after days of threats to carry out \"indiscriminate\" attacks on the US and South Korea.

Shameful really. \"I think I'll be taking photos with my daughters, female friends and colleagues instead. \"Not everyone disagreed with the sentiment by Ms Gregoire Trudeau, a mother-of-three and former entertainment news reporter.Her post received 11,000 likes and 2,300 \"hearts\" - more than the angry and crying face emojis that can also be used to react to posts on the social network. \"Ma'am, despite the backlash you're taking over this, I'd like to say thank you for the spirit of inclusion it was clearly meant in,\" wrote user Ian Stumpf.Emily Herbert wrote:  \"I can't believe the backlash!! It seems so few men are standing by us in our fight for equality. It is always nice to appreciate the ones that are. \"Ms Gregoire Trudeau also responded to people's comments on her original post. \"Well, now we're having a conversation! Thanks to everyone for your feedback and pics! Love it,\" she wrote a few hours later.Her message included a promotion for her International Women's Day events with Plan International Canada, a charity, and Equal Voice, an organisation dedicated to electing more women to political office.Ms Gregoire Trudeau added: \"Our goal is gender equality, and fighting for it is going to require men and women working together - raising our boys and girls to make a difference, hand-in-hand. This is about recognising that we should be allies on this journey. \"An outspoken advocate for gender equality, Mr Trudeau has repeatedly spoken of himself as a \"feminist\"."

        "text": "Since then, ERT has undergone several major overhauls to keep up with fierce private competition.These efforts were not entirely successful, and a fall in the company's ratings in the mid-1990s triggered a long-running debate about its cost and efficiency.Eighty per cent of the company's funding came from a licence fee included in electricity bills, and some of it was sourced from advertising revenue.Many Greeks objected to funding ERT through the licence fee, claiming that the company was too unpopular and too expensive. The broadcaster was also criticised for its openly pro-government reporting, especially since the start of the financial crisis in 2009.At the time of closing, ERT operated three main TV channels and more than a dozen national and local radio stations. ERT World TV catered for the Greek diaspora across the globe.The company's programming included news as well as factual and entertainment programmes. It claimed to broadcast more highbrow programmes - such as world cinema and documentaries - compared to the generally more light-hearted entertainment offered by its privately-owned rivals.The company's audience share in 2013 was relatively low at below 20%, with most Greeks preferring commercial broadcasters.The government's surprise decision to shut down ERT was, however, met with fierce criticism from the public. Even though most agreed that a restructuring and cost-savings were required at the company, its immediate closure was branded \"dictatorial\" by some.While most Greeks will continue getting their news and entertainment from private TV and radio stations, those in the east and some islands - where signal coverage is poor - may have to rely on Turkish broadcasters across the border.BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

        "text": "\"I was on my way to the grocery store and she stopped me and said, 'I heard you sing,'\" Hawkins recalled.Barbara Ann's sister, Rosa Lee Hawkins, soon joined them. The three later discovered they were cousins.The trio was almost known as the Meltones or Little Miss and the MuffetsBut they settled on the Dixie Cups name in 1964 after being discovered by producer and singer Joe Jones.Jones took them to New York where they recorded Chapel of Love, written by Spector, Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich.The band came up with the song's unique vocal arrangement on the spot. \"When Ellie and Jeff first played Chapel for us, we looked at each other, like, 'You really want us to sing that like that?'\" Hawkins told Rolling Stone. \"They said, 'Well, how do you want to sing it?' So I said, 'Give us a minute. '\"We went in the corner and started singing. We walked back to them and when we sang it the way it was recorded, they were just, 'Wow! That was awesome. '\"The song peaked at number 22 in the UK and was later covered by the Beach Boys.The Dixie Cups released further successful records in 1964 and 1965, including You Should Have Seen the Way He Looked at Me, Little Bell and a cover of the New Orleans standard, Iko Iko.But when their record label went out of business, the band's recording career effectively ended.Johnson quit soon after citing management and health concerns, having suffered with sickle cell anaemia. \"Because it was the early sixties, we went through a lot as far as race and a whole lot of other things,\" Hawkins said. \"We had a manager who wasn't really in our corner, but there were a lot of good times. \"Johnson occasionally rejoined the band for performances, including one at the 2010 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.She died of congestive heart failure in a New Orleans hospice on 3 October.The singer is survived by a sister, Ida, and a brother, Howard. A memorial is planned in New Orleans next week. \"The world has lost a classy lady, who had a magnificent sense of humour, a radiating smile, and was truly one of the best people we know,\" wrote the Dixie Cups on their website.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."
