When his deed was finished, the punch of recoil still fresh in his shoulder, Adam hurriedly packed his weapon and fled. He could already feel strength seeping into his legs as he ran.

They ’ d mastered the warp drive back when humans were still bashing steel swords together. The Drevs could trap our fleets and even do little microjumps with their warp drives to out-maneuver us. Our ships might ’ ve been tougher, but they were slow and bulky. The Drevs could just get under our guns and smash us to bits. At its heart, the QED was a simple device. Two particles at two different points and space are located and \" entangled. \" I do n' t really know how this all happens. It' s all quantum mechanics and plasma physics, and a lot of other bullshit that stoppers up where the engineering decks end. But, regardless, those two particles are now. .. linked. You can send data between them, and its somehow stored. Somehow. I did talk to a few of the engineers on the hyperdrive, but all they could tell me is stuff like “ space-time strings ” and “ quantum wires ” and a lot of other stuff that sounded more like random combinations of words that made sense on their own, but together became a faucet of gibberish. But, that ’ s not the end of it. Then, the hyperdrive takes two snapshots simultaneously. The first is the location of every particle that is currently part of the ship: every atom, every proton, every inconspicuous bit of dust is analyzed down to the quark level. The second snapshot is the velocity of all those particles. Which is why the CO ’ s are always wanting us to keep our bunks sparkling clean. One miscalculation, and suddenly you ’ re missing half your face. I ’ ve heard horror stories. People just disappear sometimes when they ’ re working on the hyperdrive and we jump. All the find is piles of radioactive ash. Whatever the consequences, the QED works. We sucker punched the Drevs right back to their home star system. They never stood a goddamn chance. Our ships crushed their docked capital fleets when they leaped, seemingly out of nowhere, and ambushed their shipyards at the Battle of Falcron. Then, we struck again at the Battle of N ’ rangard, turning an entire fleet, supported by a Drevian battlecarrier fielding fighter after fighter, to scrap. When we reached Drevon Prime, they begged for surrender."

Faster and faster, careening harmlessly through the sky, the land below simply grew as it came closer, a flower of browns and greens and blues and grays, blooming into a epitaph of trees, grass, dirt, water, garbage, and cityscape. A sight that warms the soul much more than the biting cold of the wind, a view that makes you happy to be alive, a new glance into the world we walk right on top of! Skyscrapers that were once giant now teeny beneath your feet! People reduced to the size of ants, smaller even! A flick of a wrist and there' s a solid length of steel, a superbly grand culmination of thousands of years of technological advancements right beneath my feet.

On her 18th birthday, she was allowed to leave her home and live the life that she always wanted. She packed her bag full of knives and matches, then left her home for good. She vowed to never return, and just to make sure she kept her promise, she burned her house down, trapping her parents inside. She hired a cab and told the driver to take her to the closest large city. Once there, she stabbed the driver in the neck and gouged out his eyes. Feeling so happy and gleeful, she decided to run down a dark alley. The alley smelled like a mixture of warm garbage and cat shit. She ran her tongue across the brick walls and tasted the car exhaust that had built up in the mortar of the buildings. She felt quite erotic and began to moan, and scream obscenities at the cesspools which collected in the middle of the asphalt. A man in a large thick coat woke up and started to run to the street. Myrnwl laughed and threw trash at him. He fell hard and cut his eyebrow open. The blood dripped into his eye as he crawled into the open world. The people began to pass him and only gave a stare of horror and shock. He begged that they not pass him up. He needed their help, but who would help a homeless man? He was a burden of society, a blight on the civilized world, he was inferior. Myrnwl was saddened by this. She made a resolve that no one shall pass him today. She began to shriek with laughter as she neared him -- her cackling echoing down the dark alley louder and louder. While he was on all fours, she straddled him. People could hear him scream \" No! \" She disemboweled him in front of everyone. Then she pulled his entrails out and extended his organs across the sidewalk. People began to vomit and faint at the sight of the man begging for mercy. He tried to gather his guts, but she would n' t let him. His blood began to darken on the concrete, and it was certain the no one would pass him that day. The End: )"

First, the men would come come back will less and less. The meat that used to taste so delicious became nothing more than fat and gristle. Furs and silks were few and far between and Katiya only had the memory of sweets. \" Why is there no laughter, Papa? \" she had asked, noticing his face was lined with worry. \" Why are things changing? \" Her father had placed a tired smile on his lips. \" It will be okay soon, myshka, \" he assured her, patting her head and she had believed him.

Katiya saw too many of her tribe members fade away into nothing. She feared she would be the only one left. Every day, she would wake up with her father and watch him disappear into the darkness with the other tribesmen, desperate. And every evening, she would see the disappointment and despair etched onto their faces. Eventually, the world began to turn on them. Instead of being the hunters, they became the hunted. Beasts stalked them with new found confidence, waiting for the perfect time to pick them off -- finally high enough on the evolutionary ladder to take revenge. The first day they had come back one man short, the stares of the tribesmen were hollow and their clothes were painted in blood of their friend. After that, there would always be one or two less men with them when the returned. Instead of silently watch her father go into the unknown, Katiya began to cry and beg him not to leave. \" Hush, myshka, \" he would say, wiping away her tears. \" Papa will always return to you. \" And then, one day, he did n' t.

Well, it turns out that my dad was right. When I got to school, I gave my best friend a hug, and when I did, I felt the tiniest little tingle. That meant something, right? Yep. Turns out it did. When I let go, my hands felt weird. Like there was something stuck to them -- and so I look at my hands, and that' s when I found out. My hands were.. different. They were certainly noticeable. *Glittery*, you could say. The rest of the day, anyone looking for me knew just how to find me. All they had to do was follow the trail I was leaving. Diary, my superpower sucks."

        "text": "Your prompt happened to remind me of something I had thought about ages ago. The mystics observed the future of this conquest during the warp trip. Multiple light units spent weaving the spell with many more reading the fates and seeing their doom. Such is the way of our crusade. Countless planets have been dominated, countless slaves put under our command, and countless minerals stripped from their crust. Each world fought, but each was crushed as we knew how they would fight. The mystics watched the weave of fate and picked out the strand that gave us the best victory. This was meant to be another one of our empire. Another one to be crushed and stripped. Another to be enslaved and worked. For the first time in our history, perhaps since even the first time in creation, the mystics were wrong. There was supposed to be a single human. One that would lead their armies against us, Inspire them, Rally them, But ultimately, trap them. The hero was one of the twenty-five warriors who fought against us in the initial bout. We were supposed to kill the rest, capture him, implant him, and control him. He would be our puppet, leading the others to their destruction. But when the time came for us to strike, there were twenty-six warriors against us. Our army faltered. The hero we were meant to take was instead killed in our confusion. We ended up with the twenty sixth warrior: The one who the mystics did not see. We brought him to our ship and the mystics shrieked in terror. His past, his future, even his very existence, was hidden from them. In a panic, they turned their focus to the planets surface and found that there were millions like him. Millions we were blind to. They realized that the force hiding them was ancient and purposeful. This was not simply a random act of fate, nor was it an evolution of this species. Someone on this planet had once been able to touch the aether like can now. They weaved a powerful blessing and placed it on his spawn, making them hidden from other prying eyes. We had to flee. A direct conflict with this species, although would end in victory, would leave us with too many casualties. The human we took was fired back to the planet. We lied to him and claimed that this was a show of our species power and that they are never to leave this system. Hopefully the others believe it. Our empire could collapse if another species were to find out what these humans are capable of."

        "text": "Only once she had reached the relative safety of the wind-swept roof did she stop to examine her prize. The tooth gleamed under the light of a half moon, and Widders smoothed her quivering whiskers with an idle paw as she pressed one large, fuzzy ear against its surface. The tooth hummed with a gentle song, a refrain that spoke of summer sun, and wood smoke, and the scent of rain. The song played over and over—the bark of a dog, a slice of light through a dusty room and, under it all, a tiny note of loneliness. Widders chittered happily to herself as she cleaned the tooth with a scrap of clean linen. Magic made with memories was quite potent, and the teeth of children always held a bit of a soul—a bit of childhood itself tossed as the body made way for adult things. This made a good tooth extremely valuable, especially since the actual harvest of human children had gone out of general practice a long time ago. Widders snorted at the thought and cleaned faster. Some of the Fae lamented the loss of their old ways, but Widders ’ s kind, who had always been considered small and weak, were quite adaptable. The changes of the modern world had been good for them, and their services were now in high demand. Widders already knew that the Troll, who spoke in words like falling pebbles, would appreciate getting her greedy claws on this little prize, come Market day. Slowly, and with great care, Widders slid the tooth back into the pouch she wore snugly against her side. It made a nice clinking sound as it tapped against a couple of cuspids she had collected earlier in the night. Across the city, a dozen more songs called out to her, and she raced off, eager to trade bits of shiny human coin for something infinitely more valuable."

As if his desire to change things now was amplifying his memories of that feeling. As he got desperate in his craving, something snapped. He looked around himself, and instead of living on the street, he found himself in a small room on a cheap, but comfortable bed.

In an hour of effort, he managed to amplify all of his gut feelings in the past to the point of making the right choice. He found himself rich, and surrounded by the loving family. His wife was holding his hand, his kids and grand kids were standing around. When he closed his eyes before drawing his last breath he realized that he did n' t feel any different. He was alone, at this moment, with his eyes closed and darkness enclosing him and this very second, all of his beautiful life was as much of a dream as his horrible one. He opened his eyes, and saw the dark dirty street, and rainy sky above his head. He wished it so much that for a second he believed it was real.

Any bozo with a pen and eyesight can sit there and talk about the nuances of brushstroke in the post-renaissance era and the play of shadow and light on an image of the rolling hills - it is n' t hard. I know jack shit about all that stuff, but I sounded perfectly plausible just there, right? What I do - what *I* do is hard. Other people - they critique movies ( note: Chris Pratt wears too many clothes ) or food. But me? I do serial killers. For example: The Gardener - working in south London, he' d leave a beautiful white rose at the scene of every murder. Weapon of choice - claw hammer to the back of the skull. The macabre play of gruesome violence juxtaposed with the simple beauty of the white rose, never once spattered with blood made him one of the more artistically inspired killers on the South London scene. It was a definitive blow to the quality of killings when the police finally brought him to justice in 2008. The local scene has largely been lacking in noteworthy additions - there was brief hope when a series of hangings swept through the city, a rash of what appeared to be suicides at first but police later confirmed to be murders. The press went wild, and The Hangman ( a name I' m proud to have coined ) was briefly the darling of the local circuit. Sadly it was revealed not to be the work of a divinely inspired artist working on the human body, but merely a standard practice of the Dixie Mafia, who were inexplicably trying to muscle in. The gang war was long and bloody, but contained no repeat killings of particular interest so I largely stopped paying attention. Being a serial killer critic is hard work. Most of the time, I just sit here at my desk, flicking through police reports. .. and waiting."

He too wanted to go home, but knew he was stuck in class. He divided his attention between the other students and the outside, making sure not to look at Zachary. Zachary continued to sit in the corner. He did not speak to anyone. He did not look at anyone. In the row ahead of Zachary, Chris Phillips sat at his desk. His backpack was on the desk, and Chris fidgeted quietly with the zipper. There were patches all over the black backpack of his favorite bands. He traced one finger along a patch, while zipping with another. He focused on his backpack, in what could be the last few minutes of highschool for him. Jason Helmsley sat closest to the door.

It wasn ’ t that the material was a challenge, Naif had no problem absorbing every concept she came across and she had more degrees than anyone her age to prove it. Life had always been that way. In primary school she related better to adults than her classmates. In secondary school she was respectful of her teachers but felt she understood the lessons they taught to a deeper level than even they appreciated. University had been much the same except the distance between herself and her professors had turned her conscientious respect into a degree of begrudging disdain. She was certainly more intelligent than anyone she knew of, more so than anyone she had ever met. She picked apart the documents piled high on her desk recalling even the articles in the citations that she had previously read. Today her eyes were heavy, mostly with boredom, somewhat with the strain. Her mind was as sharp as it had ever been but her body showed the signs that she would not be considered a young woman for much longer. Through the closed windows she could vaguely hear the muffled hum of the world rushing by outside. Suddenly the monotony of the day fell away as it was unbound by a sharp thud against the outer wall of her office. Naif quickly straightened her hunched shoulders and bumped the table sloshing coffee over her meticulously curated stacks of research papers. She snarled impatiently at the mess and sprang to the window. She squinted through the blinds at the sunlit scene then furrowed them even further in annoyance. The neighbours were playing baseball with their kids again. Idiots. Hadn ’ t they any respect for others? One of the little morons ran up to the edge of Naif' s apartment, beneath her field of view, and tried to throw the ball back. It careened off course and the cretin had to go pick it up again to return it to his waiting family. Naif rolled her eyes as she turned away from the display of incompetence and inefficiency that played out beyond her walls. As she sopped up the spilled coffee from her desk she mumbled to herself, as she had before, “ I wish everyone were more intelligent. I would have so much more to share with them, so much more in common. They run around all day never thinking of their actions, of their futures. Such wasted potential in all that frivolity. ” Though as she settled back into her comfortably worn chair she couldn ’ t help feeling that there was something more to it that she just didn ’ t quite understand."

All things in the universe must follow a pattern, and I would be a revolutionary by determining this pattern. I had come to the conclusion that the last piece of the equation I needed was something related to fractals. Pure symmetry in nature, like a glimpse into the inner workings of space and time. All I needed was the constant. All I needed was… All that I… my mind gave up. I slept. I dreamt that I was eaten lizard-like creature. We were face to face, though I felt no fear. His blazing eyes seemed to stare into my soul as he opened his moth. The creature then swallowed me whole, and I fell into the pit of his stomach. As I faced my impending doom, I noticed the ringlets that surrounded the inner lining of his abdomen. The circular shapes seemed to grow, becoming three dimensional and surrounding me in a flash of light. Next thing I knew I was awake and writing. “ Of course! ” I said aloud as my hand scribbled rapidly. The constant was pi; the ratio of a circle' s circumference to its diameter. A wave of joy had given me new energy. I now had all of the pieces of the puzzle. My equation was cause-and-effect based, taking into account current laws of physics to determine how actions will play out in the future. With this equation, I would have infinite luck. I had developed a software to interpret data from my life, and apply the equation, thus giving me the best course of action to obtain prosperity for the rest of my life. Now, all that was left was to plug in pi. I typed the number 3. 14, held my breath, and clicked enter. Words popped up on the screen. It read: *It is a beautiful night, go for a walk! * Grinning like a escaped manic, I threw on my coat an ran out the door, ready for whatever luck was to come my way. I proceeded to look up at the sky and take in the beauty of the heavens above. One particular star caught my eye, The North Star.

        "text": "His speech, for better or for worse, will change the future forever. As his speech writer, I feel quite a bit of pride, but I must admit I am feeling quite apprehensive. The last speech I wrote of this magnitude was only three months ago, when the good Emperor was officially declaring war against America, the only nation standing between China and complete global domination. That speech had spurred into action over three hundred Robotic facilities in China, followed by thousands and thousands of robots. There were, of course, those opposed to bringing robots into the war as they could n' t even attack the Americans, leaving the robots an entire waste of money and effort. The robots produced, however, were not made to attack the Americans. Their height is 7' , and they are 3' wide, but they are as quick and powerful as a lion; an intimidating army, if they were hostile. Emperor Daicho found a way to use them, of course. Aside from the standard robots being used to transport ammunition and supplies, he tried to use the robots to lead the charge into battles. Once at the enemy lines, they would proceed to grab all ammunition and pieces of cover possible before retreating back. The robots refused, for removing ammunition or cover from the opposing side would inevitably bring harm to humanity, and so they refused. And then he tried using them as armor, a moving wall of cover. This too failed when they picked up our army and carried them all away to safety. We are now at the beginning or the end of Robotic-Warfare. Emperor Daicho is taking the stand now, and I am afraid I still have my doubts on this entire plan working. Two days ago China dropped a biological weapon on America; a gas that carries with it tiny parasites that dig into the flesh of humans, finally resting where the appendix used to be. If the appendix is still there, the parasite will grow until it is big enough to eat it' s way out. The parasite, after approximately 244 years, will be in control of the brain. Of course it' s host will never live to that age. Emperor Daicho will now announce the news that all Americans ( 87 %, truthfully ) have been infected with an alien parasite and are no longer human. If the robots continue to refuse in aiding us to kill the Americans, we will have to use nuclear power. May the gods help us all."

I was running a routine scan of the outer materials of the 4th Sol Cloud when my sensors noticed it. It was radiating a very weak signal that fell into the same spectrum as a dying pulsar. My automated algorithms isolated it as nothing more than background noise, the universe itself simply being, but my higher level filters noticed something familiar.

Wrapping their stick thin arms around me, their little hospital robes flapping in the wind and their thin pales faces looking up at me with adoration. That and fact that I had just lost my child, but saved so many others. That a man, who had lost so much, could find redemption in saving so many. Since then, I' ve defused other devices. Somehow surviving, dispute my carelessness and lack of knowledge. Nothing quite as personal or spectacular as what happened in that evacuated cafeteria, beneath the fluorescent lights, and the impartial eyes of camera and the mural' s cartoon animals. But that' s going to change. That first device would n' t, could n' t have worked - but the next one will. You see, you can learn a lot from reverse engendering the work of others and you can build something amazing out of broken and discarded parts. I' m going back to the hospital. My daughter had more than one backpack."

My temple throbbed, the pounding in my ears so loud that it almost felt like someone shouting at me, screaming my name over and over.

On the verge of blacking out, my vision suddenly cleared, and the throbbing died down, almost as quickly as it had started. Sweat beading on my brow, I looked down at my hands and took a deep breath. Definitely getting worse. I glanced around. The street was quiet, but that gun shot would have attracted attention. A quick search through the stranger' s pockets yielded nothing of consequence. The Glock, a spare magazine and an unmarked pen drive. No wallet, badge or discernible I. D. Black Ops then. They were closing in on me. \" No Reset.

My eyes seem to slide away from his form before I could register any details. \" You' re getting stronger David. But you lack control.

Staggering advances in forensic investigation and a general awareness of vampirism has made it nearly impossible to convince the world that someone would just vanish into the night with a stranger, never to be seen again. Now there' s a camera on every corner and in every pocket. Everyone is so connected that no disappearance goes unnoticed. So I' m reduced to feasting upon my fellow homeless just to avoid a diet consisting entirely of rats and stray pets. The identity I had is no longer safe to use, and the great societies of the past have been all but dismantled. The predator has indeed become the prey. And all we have to show for millennia of evolutionary dominance are a few bad books and a crumbling mythos. We used to be feared and respected; even revered by some. Now, we' re the butt of a cultural joke, and battling extinction at the frayed edges of society. We must feed upon filth to survive, and have become filth as a result.

As one last gift I have tried to dream enough of my spirit into this statue to keep the structure of our world together intact. I do this with all of my love. \" Barely able to read the last words through the tears in my eyes I screamed. The wind started to rise as it reflected my emotion. Unwilling to do any damage here I began to will myself away but stopped as I heard a small child ’ s voice behind me. “ Hey mister, where am I? ”"

The others there might have weird behavior, but still, they has photographic memory. Sooner or later, I was shunned. By teachers and students alike. Sooner or later, my parents refused to acknowledge me. They only cared about my older sister, who was a scholar in her school. Sooner or later, I got bullied. Why? Why did I have to be born differently. That was what I asked myself. But after my schooling, I realised that perhaps it was n' t such a bad thing. As I look the others who had been bullied before, they could n' t forget. Permanently scarred where they. I, on the other hand, had forgotten the worst parts and could carry on with life. That was when I started smiling again. Then, my parents died in an automobile accident. For days, I grieved. Though they did n' t treat me very well, they were still my parents. So like my sister, I grieved. But unlike her, I soon forgot. Not completely but still, enough to make me functional again. The pain was still there. But it was lesser. So, I carried on with life, unlike my sister. I soon settled with my soulmate. She was a historian, studying the days before the modification that made photographic memory a reality. She was intrigued by how I could forget stuff, and carry on with life. And we became soulmates and settled down. We had a beautiful boy. One day, a teacher called me. She said that my boy had a \" learning disability' ' and could not remember things. I just replied that I knew how to handle it and put down the phone, smiling. My son will be free."

Nobody was aware of the devestation that just ensued within the last second. Meanwhile, a massive meteor the size of South Africa has just breached the earth' s atmosphere, and would be due to make contact just as the aliens hovering above would uncloak their ships and begin bombardment of Earth. A kaiju pokes its monstrous head out of the water, just off the coast of Japan ( Now heavily damaged by the eruption of every volcano in the Ring of Fire at once ), ready to lay devastation until humanity was vanquished. A heavenly ray descended onto the earth, those true to their faith would merely begin to rise to the kingdom of the Lord, and the ground would tear apart with the legions of hell beginning their charge from below. The sound of the Gjallarhorn is heard across the world, with the warriors of Ragnarok minutes away from the final battle. At the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, Cthulhu' s eye shot open, and millions begin to feel the initial symptoms of madness induced by the force of comprehending his presence. In the cosmos, the sun just began to experience a completely inconcievable premature supernova, and swells to about a second' s worth of additional girth. This was just as the effects from another cosmic supernova travelled the millions of lightyears to devastate Earth. A black hole ( separate from the that had just been created at the Large Hadron Collider ) had just entered local space and began its influence on Neptune, bound straight for Earth. Of course, this would all be superceded by the fact that the core of the Milky Way Galaxy had exploded, and the devastation from this had just arrived from its Billions of years trip across the cosmos.

Beautiful green eyes that he got lost in. He gently felt the baby ’ s cheek with a finger and smiled when she cooed in response. A tap on his shoulder brought him back to reality. The nurse made a motion to ask if he wanted to hand her back. Suddenly, he was aware of how sore his arms were. Rocking the baby back and forth had made him even more tired than he already was, but he shook his head. He felt as if he could hold her forever as looking at her face made him forget he was ever tired. A gentle voice called out to him. “ Mr. Adams, would you please follow me ”. He looked up and saw a doctor and he remembered why he felt so tired in the first place. Reluctantly, he turned to the nurse and motioned him over, placing his child in his care before going to follow the doctor down the long hallways. He was glad they closed her eyes. He wouldn ’ t be able to bear seeing those beautiful verdant eyes so full of life be glossy and still. The doctor began to apologize, “ We ’ re sorry for your loss, we did everything we could ”, he continued on but the words were but white noise as he slipped back into his long dream. He felt like crying, but it took energy to cry and all he felt like doing was sleeping. After all was said and done the doctor brought him back outside. He began to drift towards the exit signs like a moth drawn to a flame when his eyes caught a man sitting on a bench holding a small bundle in his arms. Without needing to be told the nurse brought her over to him and he once again felt the weight of her small existence. He was tired still, but he had much to do now before he could sleep."

She had the prettiest hair I ’ d ever seen on a woman. I could actually make out the color of it. It was a pure golden blonde hue, magnificently streaking across her midnight blue canvas.

I love the workshops, but they' re difficult to write, especially with a lot of research involved in some. It does n' t help to avoid burning out when we do n' t have a lot of participants. Another reason why I enjoy creating these posts, is because mods are often seen as rude people obsessed with power. Coming from behind the scenes, we' re not. We' re human and we' re writers. We promote just like everyone else, because, I know for me, I' d like my pieces to reach a wider audience and give back some of the enjoyment and entertainment I' ve felt from others. We mod because we want to make this community better. Get to Know a Mod is not meant to be a self promotion, but I do leave it up to the mod doing it that week to write whatever they' d like within it ( as long as they have the Rules and Introduction ). On Mondays we even promote one writer a week with our writer spotlight, so if you know some good writers who deserve the spotlight, send them our way. The posts that you' re talking out, stickying PIs, and CCs are stickied all day Tuesdays, and our Mods Choice is our way of getting out lesser known prompts. I can assure you we do n' t think we' re better than anybody else on this subreddit. We keep it as clean and of nice as a default as we can. The mods here, especially the ones that run weekly posts, work hard to create a good space for writers. The Get to Know a Mod is supposed to be fun. It' s a way for people to ask for advice if they need it, or just get to know our mod team if they' re not on our IRC chat. Hope this clears some things up."

Searching wildly underneath every pillow he could find, his fingers came into contact with cold metal. John grasped the necklace in both hands and closed his eyes to try and slow his breathing. He unravelled the chain and held his most prized possession in his hand - an old, brass key. John moved his right hand under his left breast, tracing the outline of a hidden keyhole where his heart should be. John inserted the key, but it would not turn. \" Mornin' Sunshine! \" said Melissa as she entered the room, two steaming coffees in hand. \" What the Hell is going on? ! Where is my key? \" John stood, pulling out the mismatched key as he did so. \" I have it and I gave you the key to mine in return. \" Though she tried, Melissa could not hold back her smile. \" C' mon, you could n' t have thought you were the only one! \""

It was not until I heard the lightsabre-whoosh of electricity that I paused, scanning my kaleidoscopic world of fractured images for the source of that sound. A dry cackle filled the tense silence. Then out of nowhere, a rush of air flattened the hairs of my legs. I darted forward, frantically making for the darkness of the sofa. I had barely moved a few centimetres when a dreadful crash deafened me. My legs gave way and I pressed myself into the cold marble floor. As the ringing around my ears subsidised, I became aware of a metal grille pressed just above me, the lick of electricity hot and sweaty on its cruel lips. Nursing an awful feeling of dread, I kept motionless. A sudden twist of the metal grille above me jolted my nerves, and I instinctively darted forward, no destination in mind. It was a mistake. An incredibly loud explosion came from within my body, and my nerves were lit on fire. I surged forward madly, the world a whirling mess. It was only until I found myself under a dark sofa that I realised that the metal grilles above me must have had been lifted, if only for a moment. The subsequent hours flashed by in a daze. I vaguely remember being pushed along furtively by a few other bugs, but when I regained consciousness, I was already in the hive learning centre. Wordlessly, an intimidating helmet was lowered upon my head, and I felt my memories palpitating, almost painfully. Finally, the helmet was released, leaving me free to slither out of the room. Outside, along the corridor, the bulletin screen flashed momentarily, then reanimated with a new Mandatory Collective Intelligence Update ( MCIU ) - \" Advisory Against the Development of Electric Weaponry in Sector 11A' '. A gantry fell over the corridor, and a pair of antennae slid out from the side of the wall. To get past the gantry, everyone had to connect with the pair of antennae, downloading the advisory.

The darkness I felt slowly started to change as I realized that the plane of existence I' m in was changing. Colors i' ve never seen before engulfed my mind and eased my worry almost immediately. Slowly I drifted through each color completely at ease. As I drifted I began to understand the nature of life. It' s not about a checklist of achievements or accomplishments, I understood now that life was about spending your time enjoying the things you love and the people that make you happy. I felt elation, I felt as if I was a part of everything I knew and loved. I was now a cog in the machine of our universe, awestruck by the beauty of the afterlife. A twinge of grey overtook the color, and suddenly I was dragged away out of my beautiful tapestry of the most spectacular thing I have ever seen, felt, or even imagined. I was immediately drawn back into the black. A steady rhythm filled my mind. Beep. .. Beep. .. Beep. .. The air smelled pungent and my body felt heavy. Beep. .. Beep. .. Beep. .. I opened my eyes to a crowd of unfamiliar faces, crowding around my bed furiously scribbling down what appears to be important information. The doctor mumbles something about 67 days as I reconcile with the fact that this room is so grey and lifeless. The next few days were a blur of crying family and interviews as the media reported on my \" Resurrection' '. I answered their questions honestly, yet in the back of my mind all I could think about was that beautiful tapestry I was a part of. The world seems much colder now, even the allure of my own definition of living a good life faded with the dreary idea that I was missing out on something much bigger, much more important. So Here I stand on top of my condominium again. This time I ask that you let me stay."

Klein: If your trying to say that you are god, I would have to ask which one? We have quite a few these days. Omega: I' m not some pagan myth. I. Am. YHWH. Klein: Funny you should bring up the pagans, we have encountered others claiming to be exactly that. What makes you different? Omega: I made them to test you, they serve me. Lesser angels. Klein: And you sent them against us? I saw what happened to North Korea first hand. Omega: I promised no more floods, I am forced to use more creative measures. But you some how manage to survive. I' ve sent my horsemen and still you live. Klein: If you are what you claim to be, you should know. You created us in your image. Our knowledge of existence and non existence is significant when combined. There are quite a few of us even after recent events. Omega: I am infinite, you can not know infinity.

The anime theme fans were put down easily when it was discovered most of them did n' t understand the words to sing them. But the power of music and community could never be underestimated. Rebellions were quick to rise. Pagan folk musicians left for the forests to begin a new life. Speedcore and gabber groups teamed up in the Netherlands, their lightning-fast attacks gaining ground. Germany was a constant battleground, the NDH practitioners continually bolstering their ranks with fans from across the globe to fight an intensely fervent industrial and EBM underground all over Europe. Politically-charged groups took to the field. Separated by language but united in belief, white supremacist RAC and NSBM clans formed small but tight-knit groups chanting spells that horrified all those who heard them. Leftist groups were much larger, but more divided, and when one' s magic was charged by personal belief, it was a battle neither side could truly win. Pubs, bars and community areas were quick to keep entertainment consistently coming to ward off attacks. A capella groups, harmonisers and barbershop bands had a surge in power and popularity. Their voices were the music, nothing else, making performance on the fly easy and surprise attacks impossible. In the end, nothing could be done. To ban music outright was foolhardy, and modern life was destroyed by the constant battle. Yet, in remote villages high in the mountains, on the vast savannahs and steppes across the world, life went on as it always had, the tranquillity broken only by the traditional songs they had sung for thousands of years."

Theorists, scientists, and casuals all mulled over this data as the government seized these alien worlds for' human colonization rights' , planting our people into these expansive metropolises. In the 27th century, explorers David Smith and Lance Pumpernickel found humanity' s greatest discovery in space yet: a massive orbital station above an abandoned world, with an elevator between the station and the surface. No ships were docked with the station, and the lights were out. Nobody was home. All data had been wiped from the systems of the station, but humanity seized the station and planet for its own; evermore the scavengers, humanity stole from the ruins of ancient civilization and put it to use. Late into the 28th century, military scanners across the border systems finally picked up a signal. There was no hesitation and no delay, and the government sent out a signal back to get their attention. It immediately disappeared afterwards, and humanity was once again alone. Alone, cold, and hurt. They were greatly offended when the only alien signal they had seen yet actively avoided them. Thousands of ships were sent in the direction of the signal, a variety of diplomats, explorers, and opportunity seekers scourging the galactic country side for any hint of the Signal - that is what the media called it now: the Signal. Thousands, and soon millions, searched for the Signal for several years, finding a surplus of desolate planets and smaller alien ruins. Three years following the Signal' s spotting, a government-funded exploration group, equipped with state of the art travel, warped into a system during their usual trek for alien life. They were astounded to see a flurry of armaments flying to and fro, striking all sides of the ship. The exploration team was obliterated in seconds of its warp, with only an SOS signal sent to ping to its employers. It broke out into the media quickly and an uproar was heard from the people: many theorized that this attack was a declaration of war, and that a vast alien armada would soon arrive to re-take its ancient empire. Others claimed it was perhaps a misfire and that multiple aliens were in a war of their own. The most unpopular idea, but perhaps most truthful, is the Human Migration Theory: the alien empires of the galaxy were fleeing from humanity and would drop entire planets and run rather than risk confrontation with us. As to why this was happening no one could say, but all agreed that something must be done. [ Continuing later maybe ]"

I over acted the act of getting out the right card for the audience who let out a polite laugh. I read my traditional speech, tears were shed, and everyone looked so pleased.

        "text": "I' ll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun' s magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun' s magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze at, except at significant distance from the sun. This greater total mass makes for more planets, but since they formed in an atmosphere they are less dense and thus tend to have less attraction due to gravity. Thus, while planets in closer orbits move faster and are blistered, tornado-swept hellholes, ones in more distant orbits move more slowly and have fewer issues with wind. ( So what keeps these orbits from decaying in the face of air resistance? I dunno. Though that might be a story hook. ) Now imagine a primitive society ( Bronze Age? Renaissance? ) who is just learning to escape their planet' s gravity well using, say, giant kites that catch the occasional hugely-strong high-altitude winds that happen when their planet intersects the convection current. How do they explore this huge sea of \" space' '? Are there others out there? Does their emerging science catch the inconsistencies in their own universe? If so, what do they make of it? Yeah, I know there' s a lot of hand-waving and general bullshit here, but gim me a break: I' m making it up as I go along. Besides, if you' re creating a new universe, you can make the physics do whatever you want."

Still a mouthful, but Hodgar still felt special for having been accepted into the Order.

Elder Scrolls, mysterious artifacts that seemed to defy time and space themselves, and now one would be his own pet project. He had been studying on the history of the subject this Elder Scroll supposedly told. It dealt with the astonishing time when a Dovahkiin had arrived, right after the Empire had been fractured by the White Gold Concordat. Skyrim was teetering on seceding from the Empire, and it seemed that war was going to devour the whole province. Hodgar recalled the legends, ones that told of a man who mastered the arcane magics of the College of Winterhold. Then others that told of a woman who became a master thief, a servant of Nocturnal herself, and plundered riches from any and all she felt deserved it. Still, others told of the Dragonborn being an assassin, a Werewolf, a Vampire and more and more. The only thing that was sure, was that the individual *was* Dragonborn. That they commanded the Thu' um. That they cast down Alduin. *Three Weeks Later* Hodgar pored over the Scroll. It was impossible, but then, everything seemed possible when one read the Elder Scrolls. He could feel his eyes burning, and searing. The edges of his vision were glistening with white light. He had to take a break soon, or he' d go to quick to his permanent blindness. But. .. he looked a bit longer. He drank in the celestial knowledge. *Of course. * No wonder it was impossible. Just as there are Dragon Breaks, there are. .. nodules, in time itself. Infinities that converge. Possibilities bursting at the seams. Hodgar saw infinite Dovahkiin. Dovahkiin that rode Dragons, and Dovahkiin that animated the bodies of his slain enemies. A Dragonborn that totally abstained from violence. Others that stretched into the eons, serving Aedra and Daedra or themselves. The Dovahkiin was anyone. And worshiped as he, or her is now. .. the Faceless Divine. Hodgar rolled the Scroll up. He immediately began penning his findings. This must be sent to all of the right people."

They got all these young super heroes these days for that. Ones that still care and have hope in their eyes of a villian-less humanity. I lost that energy decades ago. Now it' s just me. Sitting in my house. Day after day. Waiting for the inevitable end. After I retired from being a super hero I spent my days doing bar tricks for old regulars. It was fun, hustling, drinking, partying. Those days too are behind me though. Now a days I wake up around 10: 30am. Move myself into my wheel chair and make my way to the kitchen. Things are pretty easy when you can move objects with your mind. Making coffee, getting the paper from the driveway, pouring milk in my cereal, turning on the television, etc. I usually spend a few hours trying to figure out the new DVR.

Seriously, those kids are messing up my lawn. Around dinner I' ll pop a microwavable in and settle in for the late afternoon news before I drift off peacefully into the night.

Trade has picked up between a previously unknown giant culture that specializes in cultivating weeping willow specimens, revamping their chances of survival all around the world. Unicorns have started recovering their ranks, and although still extremely rare, many have approached the aging Harry Potter. Life has become slow, and Harry scowls at what he let his life become, and relaxes, realizing he has everything he could ever hope for. The wind starts to pick up as Harry is thoughtfully rocking his body into a doze. The cold air whips his ever shaggy hair around the sides of his head, revealing a now very faint lightning-shaped scar. As he reaches down to pick up his pipe and mandrake leaves, the wind, gray and relentless, blows seemingly into the forest. Harry instinctively grabs his wand. He felt this wind once before, a very long time ago in his first years of wizarding school. He slowly stands, staring intently into the forest, stepping off of the old porch in his ever-defensive position. His scar has started burning. Burning in a cauterizing, writhing pain, Harry reaches up only to be burned by his scarred brow. \" Voldemort, \" Harry utters. The trees whip and crack from the stress of the wind. A mighty explosion echoed from the middle of the now excited forest, casting a huge plume of green light and smoke to an all too familiar symbol of a skull and slithering snake. The forest bends out with an equal energy of wind consumed beforehand, casting limbs thirty meters. \" He has returned, \" Harry mumbles as he sprints toward the forest, \" He had another horcrux! ?' ' Harry stumbles, and slows. He discovers his futility. He will never win against a now newly risen Voldemort. He now realizes what the final horcrux could have been. \" Success, equality, and tolerance, \" he stutters with bated breath, \" can not exist without. .. . chaos. .. .' ' Harry falls to his knees.

It was our beginning and will be our end, need we remind ourselves of our fate? No, no we do not you reason, still, in compliance with that, we did not create this void to herald a message of doom.

The new hoomans were too bumbly, like when my hooman drinks the brown bottle funny smelling pee liquid. And from the sound of their yelling, they found my present I caught for my hooman. My hooman grabbed the big wooden stick and took off, probably to go get its present. My hooman always thinks my gifts to it are neat. I went back to bed, nothing more I cared to do.

It was what we loved to do. Most couples have a song, we had a small path that began just inside Gateway Park. My favorite things were the plants. Big, small, leafy, sprightly, nothing really fascinated me so much as watching something grow, watching it slowly make progress, fighting against the sky. I was drawn to the ground, I suppose. One of my own quirks. She drew me up. She loved the sunset, the kiss of the wind. She saw what I could n' t in them. She raised my gaze, changed my perspective. Our second-to-last walk was last October. Shortly after that, she was diagnosed. She had been feeling poorly, coughing often, but we could never have expected it. Lung cancer. We could n' t understand, no matter how hard we tried. Lung cancer was a smokers disease, and she had never had even one cigarette. Her health deteriorated quickly. Soon enough, the daily walks became too much of an exertion, and she was confined to her bed. I tried to stay by her, but she passed away one day while I was at home, grabbing her some magazines. The doctors say that she had waited until I left, though for the life of me I' ve never understood why. Our last walk was the day after her funeral. She could n' t have made it, even if she had wanted to, but I felt I owed it to her. One last time, walking amongst the flowers. I' ve always been a meek man. Without her, I felt I had nothing left for me on Earth. Without her, I wondered if my life would even be worth continuing. As I walked, the thoughts swarmed me, preying on my weakness. I made it up to the top of Gateway Park' s hill. I' d never really been much physically, but I felt I owed her one last look at the sky. As I gazed over the park, I wondered if maybe it would have been better just to swiftly pass, to join her again. Then I felt the wind' s sweet kiss, and knew that would n' t be necessary."

Five years earlier, Sam had gone through a divorce with her husband. It was n' t messy, there was no fighting. It was more of a contract- they had both agreed that it was for the best. Sam was a changed person, and if she wanted to embrace her new self she had to leave the past behind her. That meant getting a divorce with Harry. She remembered the exact way that he had reacted when she had told him her choice- he merely nodded and thanked her for their time together. Honored, he said he was. He had never been abusive, or even gotten angry with her. In fact, she took the lead in anything they did together. He was more of an assistant than anything. Thirteen years they had been together, Although Sam never found it ironic that the divorce came then. It was n' t unlucky for her, it was how things had to be. Her boyfriend, Derek, never asked much about her old life. He knew she had been married before, but never truly asked about it as she did n' t seem to want to talk about Harry. \" He' s a good guy, \" she told him whenever he asked. And that was the end of that. But internally, she remembered the old days, and sometimes even missed them. Her and Harry were partners; worked together. Every job they did, they did cooperatively and efficiently, and there were none better than the two of them. Sam held fondly onto the memories of their fancy home-cooked dinners before their outings. The way they always had flowers on hand, thanks to their beautiful garden. So Sam was anything but surprised to see the vase of roses on her desk. They were beautifully arranged. She did n' t have to read the note to know who they were from; she just closed her eyes, exhaled slowly, and waited for the knife to reach her throat."

It glops and slides down the walls. If you stand under the cover it will occasionally fall down with a wet plop onto ground. Heaven forbid you are standing under it after it falls. When the wind is blowing in your direction you can taste it. It' s probably the spores from the mold that cakes the joints. A dusty cakey feeling will coat your tongue. It' s like chalk mixed with finger paint. Even a five year old would hesitate to eat it. When you' ve made it this far do n' t touch it. A man touched it once. Within minutes he broke out in a rash. A few minutes after that he had pustules weeping from the rash site. He called an ambulance and patiently waited. By the time the EMTs got to him he was a crying, pus weeping, curled up mess on the sidewalks. An entire wing of the hospital closed down to prevent the spread of whatever he had. One would think that no one would use this bus stop. Most would be correct. The bus stop often is n' t used for catching a bus. Homeless people use it as a shield to masterbate or have sex with each other. Teens use it to smoke behind or have beers. The sounds of their laughing and moaning filters through the layers of the bus stop and haunt anyone who happens to be standing there. The bus stop does something to the sounds. It perverts them.

Damn, that song about God being a girl was so true. \" Name? \" she whispered in a tone so soft, yet seemingly permeating through the air. \" Taylor James, madam' ' I replied nervously. \" Hmm. Taylor James. Your resume here shows nothing of significance in the past 10 years before your. .. untimely death. \" her voice resonated through the room, in crisp and clear voice, much louder this time. \" Give me just ONE reason why I should n' t kick you out and bring the next person in. Pretty impressive resume on his side. He did, after all, shot Donald Trump and prevented a world war. \" Snap. How do you even top that? Nobody told me I could get into heaven by shooting someone. I went through my whole life trying to minimize the damage I caused to people. If I knew that one act was all I needed to get sent to heaven. .. \" Well, Madam, I made sure never to harm anyone.

To many, this would be a most unfortunate event; to me, it could n' t have come at a better time. After years of dodgy schemes, underground poker games, and borrowing from the wrong people, I owed in excess of the GDP of a small Eastern European country to some individuals you would n' t want to introduce to your catholic parents. Nevertheless, through the wonderful art of reversed psychology, I had actually managed to convince the loan shark consortium to which I owed so much money to give me one last chance. I gathered all the that I had saved, robbed and otherwise put my hands on and headed to the nearest casino, intent on betting it all on the tinted red, the gamble of all gambles, the roulette spin of the century. As luck would have it, I just so happened to cross a \" Judgement Day is coming! \" lunatic hobo on the way, and, in what can only be described as a drug-fear-and-adrenaline-fuelled stupor, I change coursed and aimed my sinking ship towards a bookies. Inspired by the chance encounter, I bet everything but my clothes on the one-in-infinity odd that the world would end within a week. When the loansharks heard the details of the absurdity which was my bet, their immediate instinct was, rather reasonably, to hang, draw, and quarter me. They had, however, a reputation to preserve, and even in the face of the most improbable of events, they entertained the one-week period to let the world end before showing me why their consortium was the greatest source of income for six different mortuaries in the district. As the cosmic joke which life is would have it, the only lucky moment in my life would coincide with the Apocalypse, saving me from an excruciating death, obliterating my debt and my would-be killers, and bankrupting both the bookies and their insurance agency, technically making me the richest person in history. To be sure, I was obliterated with them all, as was all the money, but the hilarity of the situation, for one, did not go unnoticed, and I amusingly watched the end of it all with a grin.

Perhaps it was one of those forgotten little, important things that had managed to survive whatever she' d been through to attain power over shadows. Like his dancing was, for him. He followed her tune, humming along as best he could. Ever so slowly, he tried to draw his flame away from himself. It was n' t easy. He could command his fires easily enough. With a thought, his flames could materialize anywhere he wished. It was difficult being apart from the flames. His flesh felt naked as the fire coalesced to a bright point above his shoulder. He could barely stop himself from looking around in case anyone attacked. Alice squeezed his hands slightly. She was trying to draw her shadows away too and he saw a rare glimpse of her eyes, a normal blue pupil free of shadow black for now. He focused on the soft feel of her hands and on her determined smile. He found himself smiling too. \" Let' s dance. \" In the distance, helicopter blades whirred, drawing closer to the flames and shadows. They danced on, moving slowly further away from here."

He was n' t going to let someone else take something from him again. The figure came closer and stopped a few feet in front of Todd. He was a man who looked to be in his mid 20' s, who introduced himself of Steve. He had movie star good looks, and dressed in a very expensive suit. Steve spoke with a calming tone to his voice, yet his eyes tried to hide what appeared to be terrible pain. \" What are you doing down here at this time of night? \", Steve said, \" And what the hell are you doing with that? \" making a gesture towards Todd' s handgun. Steve took a step towards Todd, and extended his arm out. \" Give it here' ' Steve said, \" No matter how bad things are right now, they will get better. Think of it this way, if today is the worst day of your life, you' ll have nothing but good days for the rest of your life. \" Todd was amazed by this, he never had experienced this much kindness before. When Steve spoke, all his troubles seemed to drift away. Mesmerized by his voice, Todd mindless handed over his gun. \" There you go' ' Steve whispered softly, \" No need to do anything rash' '. As Steve took hold of the pistol, the pain in his eyes took over his entire face. Everything happened in the matter of seconds. The alley was lit for a brief moment.

My body weakened, and I knew I was turning – limb by limb, thought by thought – into one of them, one of the condemned slaves I saw before me. My knees gave way for the unfathomable weight of my mind, and I crashed backwards, back into known reality. But nothing in that vision – nothing at all – was as horrifying as what I saw next. Opening my eyes again, I saw not hell, but heaven. The luminous completeness of the unfaltering God himself, the true creator of all; perfection without end nor beginning. I became inexorably aware that it was not I who watched Him, but He who watched me, penetrating the darkest layers of my mind with the same ease with which sunlight cuts through shadow. My shortcomings, my faults, the entire history of the failed human being I was; all laid bare and judged by Him who embodied the completeness of their opposites. I understood then that the many-headed beast had no power over me, for it was not he who would condemn me to eternal damnation; no, it was Him, the One who was presently cutting through my whole self, finding me unworthy of being in His presence."

The lights had been out for almost an hour, and I had been in one of the most remote segments of the facility dropping off a package for Dr. Horz, one of the biotech R & D gurus. I had been stumbling around for what felt like ages, but my watch did confirm that it was only 56 minutes. *56 minutes of noiseless terror*. This particular R & D facility of Tegra was filled with wonders, but it was very nearly empty. I was in my second week of interning, a lowly, aspiring electrical engineer. Thus far, I had done little more than grunt work with the odd bit of logic design. Mostly just documentation though. Endless documentation. The ground stopped trembling, and the lights slowly inked a light incandescence. The walls in front of me slowly illuminated, and I was peering at a tremendous vault. A vault door—to be specific. A vault door…which was slightly cracked open. The metallic alloy comprising its structure wasn ’ t flush with the surrounding wall. And then the door started cracking open more. The noise was probably the most frightening thing. The grinding of gears and servos, attempting to hold the door shut, was echoing riotously throughout the small room. I started backing away slowly. I don ’ t know where I am. I don ’ t know what is behind that door, and I don ’ t want to be here anymore. I take a large, decisive step towards the door, and I hear a different kind of rumble—a throaty rumble, from some *thing*. And then the door quite literally gave up its effort to hold whatever was within and sprang backwards, slamming into the wall. The darkness was wholly shrouding the space beyond. A deep, primal terror was creeping into every nook of my being. What the *fuck* is happening? And then I see it. Six or seven feet in the air, slowly apparating into existence as the gentle illumination of the emergency lighting found it. A long, tube, slowly tapering to a point. No, not one. Many. The *presence* became more pronounced in the room. I watched as the objects source grew more visible. Dense, matted hair. The tubes were sprouting from it. And then the eyes. Yellow—slitted—orbs. It sprang. The last thing I perceived in those final moments, as my body was wrapped handily in a clawed grip, was a pronounced and deliberate, “ Meow. ”"

Everything, so surreal. I am no longer in the jungle, but I am painfully aware of my impending non-existence. ' No. I will not go. Not like this. ' The fire raged from somewhere deep below. The desire – no, the need for breath took over. I grasped his right arm and raised my hips to try and shift my opponent' s weight. I felt a slight wobble as I thrust upwards with all my might. Suddenly, the focus was on my opponent. The murderous intent became a panicked flurry of arms and legs from my khaki clothed assailant. I seized the initiative. Using my weight, I forced him to the ground. He curled into a ball, trying to protect his face and head. I stood above him, looming in the darkness.

While we might spoil ourselves by choosing temporary utility in joining in a contract with another human being for life, what does it provide? More life? Nay, it provides more chaos to an already tumultuous environment. Marriage. That institution is not sacred. It is a mere thought, a blink in our life. People that are consumed in the \" essence' ' of this institution are only deluding themselves for the glory of mankind. The only truth that they fail to accept, inherently, is the consequences that arise from this dreadful bond. The heartbreak, the suffering, the pouring rain over a parade, a thunder strike igniting a fire, a wave toppling a ship. All of these experiences epitomize the true nature of marriage. Thus, we reach the quintessential problem. What is the meaning of life? Biologically speaking, it is to reproduce. However, it is known that 99 % of all species that have ever existed have become extinct. Our species will be no exception to that cardinal rule. As a species, we are so brash to think ourselves important on this speck of sand in the infinite universe. We can not amount to anything, being one of millions of human beings.

Unlocking the deadbolt, he stepped outside onto the patio. *Ooh, ripe tomatoes! * He thought, glancing at the leafy stem. Refocusing, he stepped out of his gated yard and spoke into the microphone wirelessly connected to many concealed speakers about the area. \" BEHOLD MORTALS! \" He screamed, \" I AM MERLIN THE MIGHTY! \" He reached into his pocket and pulled out the smart phone also connected to the speakers. Opening the sound effects app, he fired off a bunch of thunderous roars and horrified screams. The peasant horde was afflicted with sudden fear and began to retreat, but for a single man. The populace shrank back to the copse of trees to watch the lone man advance against the scourge. \" Excuse me! \" The long man shouted, his tongue struggling around his fear. \" Foul wizard, the church has taken notice of thy crimes and demand that you immediately surrender-' ' \" Fuck you. \" Muttered the wizard as he shot the man dead with his. 45. \" HE THROWS FIRE AND THUNDER! THE ELEMENTS ARE HIS! \" The horde screamed as they fled with great trepidation.

In a last scream filled with laughter his eyes popped and he fell to the ground, dead. \" My wife used to fake orgasms, not a big deal I say, I faked the whole relationship! \" This time several people across the trench laughed. Those still alive had taken to shoving mud into their ears while firmly holding it in place with their hands.

All across the trench people fell down to the ground, their eyes popped and their mouths filled with warm blood. Suddenly the sounds of airplanes could be heard in the distance, the voice went silent and panicked voices could be heard from the other side of the trench. It was the German airborne, no amount of jokes could get them to crack, they simply could not understand the jokes. As the airborne parachuted towards the other trench you could hear the voice panicking, it started shouting off jokes as fast as it could. The jokes were unfocused and sloppy, not even the normal soldiers in the trench cracked. Shortly after the airborne landed in the other trench and the voice went silent.

That' s weird, the buzzing has n' t gone away. The door to my room opens, but I do n' t turn my head to look, just continue to stare at the ceiling.

These experiments showed that our world was n' t just probably just a simulation, but a simulation nearing the end of its use. We were near our peak processing power ( with planes disappearing to fix lag ) logical solutions and peace were becoming more feasible and more common, and the undesirable outcomes were becoming more predictable. It was theorized that since simulations are normally used to see possibilities when the outcome is n' t clear, we would soon be of no use. So now we had become more interesting. America has a socialist, a woman with current inditement issues, and as thinly veiled racist as it gets as their only viable candidates. ISIS, an undeniably evil group was wreaking havoc on the Middle East which although at a snails pace had been improving before. The Panama papers had been leaked resulting in some political turmoil. Fact had truly became stranger than fiction, so we had just received a boost in processing. The biggest concern with all this was how long we can keep this up. It' s very possible they knew about all this. Maybe they are just checking the major events and our knowledge of the simulation is unnoticed. It' s more likely though that we' re interesting because we figured it out and made moves to extend our simulation, or just that what we' ve come up with to do so is entertaining.

Tyrants and terrorists were the first to go. The hope remained even among the growing horror that maybe, just maybe, the world would show its good side. Its collective benevolence.

Weeks passed and social media was abandoned as popularity suddenly became deadly. Actors and diplomats alike fell to the vote, instagram stars and royalty. Simply having a name could be fatal if anybody else knew it. They tried to shut it off, but it had spread too far and too fast, and as governments fell one by one, the dystopian future that so many books and films promised became a reality. After two years and nearly 700 deaths, America had fallen. India had fallen. France, England, China. The great nations of the world all fell. Eventually the world ran out of famous people. A cynical commenter might have quipped about it being worth it thanks to the loss of the Kardashians, but the reality was bleak and grim. Eventually, ten votes was enough to get a person killed, as everyone was left to vote for people they knew, people who had irritated them. Even picking a name at random ran with the risk that Joe Smith had annoyed his three neighbours that day, and your random vote tipped the scale. People lost their names. It did n' t work with nicknames or pseudonyms, so it was n' t uncommon for the girl you met while trying to catch a rabbit to avoid starvation to introduce herself as Rabbit.

The only part of civilization for miles around, and its beautiful. I let go of my weapon and walk over towards the piano. Slowly, my gloves come off, revealing my hands to the pressing cold wind of the coming winter. My hand slowly flits over the warm, wooden outline, wiping off the years of dust and debris. My fingers hover over the keys as silence still rules the forest for but a minute longer. Then, with a calm heart and sound mind, I play. At first, my fingers move clumsily as I try to remember the notes and songs of my past. After a few minutes, I remember. My fingers now glide gently over the black and ivory keys as I play Beethoven, Mozart, and folk songs sung in happier times. Memories float back to my head as the notes reverberate throughout the empty forest. My father, my mother, both them are still alive. My brother and I are still friends. And I hold my love' s hand gently, like this war had never happened. I see laughter and sadness, good times and bad, I see everything. This piano brought back what I though I had lost, but now I have found. And I feel content. As the last notes of the last song I play ring against the trees, I let out a breath that I had been holding in. A smile appears on my face and I put my gloves back on to shelter my hands from the cold. I take my gun in hands again and walk away from the musical instrument. I turn around to catch one last glimpse of the solemn and stoic piano. And I let a tear fall slowly down my cheek. I do not wipe it away. I walk through the dead woods, back to my squad, back to the violence. A respite from this damned war, at least. But memories regained in the heart of this death. For one, all too brief moment, I found them again. I found peace again."

When the vocals came it, i sang along. Word for word, pitch for pitch. When it was over, i looked at my friend. He was stunned. I stammered something about a re-release, but after checking it out, there was no doubt. A song I had grown up with and known as a child was now being played as though it had only been recorded for the first time a few months ago. In college, it happened again. Twice. A new song from a different band I remembered but the version I knew was faster, and a little higher pitched. The other. .. oddity was when I once managed to make the trip from college to home in a third of the normal time- without having broken any speed limits. The cops in those little towns do n' t mess around. If I had been more than a few miles over, they' d have pegged me in a heartbeat. But by the laws of natural physics, I would have had to have *averaged* over 120 miles per hour. Maybe I crossed over and crossed back, I do n' t know. I thought it happened in my sleep, but now I think it happens between one second and the next. I' ve been lucky. I have n' t jumped too far off course. Everyone still knows me. Even if i cross in the middle of a conversation, the topic is the same, though the subtext can be wildly different. If i could pick a time when i noticed myself crossing, i could maybe learn to control it, or at least track my progress, see if i had two or three and crossed between them, or if i just cross farther and farther from home. For now its manageable. All my friends and loved ones in all the universes I' ve seen ( which means we' ve all been jumping. .. ) know about my. .. trouble, and see it as a curiosity, nothing more. My fear, though, is that the changes will be greater and more pervasive as I progress. For its own sake, that might be fascinating, but how could I cope with crossing, with no way to cross back, or guarantee that I *would*, into a universe where you and I had never met?"

Han Solo strode into the opening, one arm beckoning me towards the Falcon, the other he wrapped around David ’ s waist. This is what I was worried about. I had to board the ship. I dreaded who else I would find inside the Millennium Falcon. I had to go in though. My story has to come true. Goddamn it. Why did I have that slash fic phase?"

If the stars were a whisper, then the streetlamps were a scream. They tore a chasm into the darkness, angrily pushing it away with their ceaseless, self-assured pulsing. A streetlamp further down the street was struggling against the serenity of the dark; it flickered weakly against the tide of darkness, almost pointlessly, I thought. These midnight walks were, beyond all else, peaceful. Silence and darkness seem to be companions, but I find myself fonder of darkness over silence. A crow cawed somewhere. The sound carried endlessly, given no distractions or disturbances. Eventually, it faded into nothing. I took a detour toward the oval, stepping lightly on the soft, wet grass, and making my movements as deliberate as possible. When I reached what I imagined to be the centre, I sat down. I could feel the chilled water soak into my pants, on the sides of my shoes, my bottom and my shirt. I sighed, comfortably. I laid myself onto my back and looked up at the little dots of yellow light that jumped out of the pitch-coloured canvas above. And in this place of peace, my mind unlocked the floodgates and thoughts came pouring out. No. they rushed out. They fell over each other in a desperate race to gain my attention. They swirled and exploded forward, and my mind flew to match their speed. How can people be so cruel? How can I fix the world? I must remember to buy some chocolate tomorrow. I wonder what has happened to my high school sweetheart, all these years later? Why have n' t aliens visited us? Am I happy? Where am I headed in life? What is the meaning of life? And my mind stopped. Fixated on that question. I thought about it briefly, and then discarded it. Then I remained there, lying thoughtless for a while, my mind an utter void. In a moment, or a minute, or maybe an eternity, I got up, sighed heavily, and walked home."

But in truth, books were my escape. I was socially awkward and intelligent. This combination alone destined me for abuse all throughout my school years, so instead of becoming dark and twisted, I let my heart be filled with the writings of men and women who understood what a child really wants. Which, of course, is love. So it was no surprise that a few weeks after my seventeenth birthday, on a cold, rainy Saturday, I came across a small cake in the woods surrounding my house. “ Eat Me ” was printed on it in strange, cursive letters. The cake itself was relatively small, certainly compact enough to fit into my mouth. I did not question the cake. It could have been filled with Rohypnol or arsenic and I would have been none the wiser. The truth may be that perhaps I hoped it was. I had little to live for, and everything to give. But it didn ’ t. The cake tasted sweet but slightly stale. It could have been out there for weeks. I did not feel myself growing, as Alice had, nor did I feel any change taking place over me, except for a slight tingling at the base of my skull. Saddened by the revelation that I was not any different from an ordinary human, and that my white-bread existence was going to stay just that, I trudged home, my head low. My mother was sitting in the living room when I entered and looked up briefly. “ How was your outing? ” she asked. “ Wonderful, mother, ” I said. “ It was the best day of my life. ” She looked a little surprised at my sarcasm, but did not say anything.

Only minutes ago this had been a bustling party but now all was silent as more then twenty people stood or sat, frozen in place almost. Finally the announcement came to an end.

I was leaning against the building, just watching. That' s when I saw her in the crowd; the girl from next door.

The locals had eventually caught on, but they had attracted a bit more attention than they had counted on, from further off. I was tempted to be angry at the gang, but reflected - they had given me six years, and my hoard was now bigger than it would have been after a hundred. All in all, it had been a good deal."

He would return with the skulls of fallen legends, chests filled with dwarven gold, and piles of jewels the likes of which the woman had never seen before. He was a successful warrior. The child was born a son, and the great warrior swelled with pride. A son to carry on his tradition. Years passed by, and as the sone grew with time, the father tried his best to train the boy. He would learn to use his father' s sword, practicing against the scarecrows of his village. Then, at the age of seven, the father knew it was time to send his soon-to-be great son into his first real fight. He brought the boy to the mouth of a wolves den and told him. \" Return to me with the pelt of the mother wolf, but leave the pups alive. \" The young boy swallowed his fear, and walked into the dank, odorous den. As his eyes adjusted, he could hear the yelps and yaps of the wolf pup, playing under their mother' s watchful eyes. Then, deep within the cave he hear a gravely growl. The boy stepped forward, his sword raised in the air, ready for battle. Before he could bring down his first swing, the mother wolf has the boy' s throat in her jaws. She bit down, slamming the boy' s back to the ground. Soon, the boy was nothing more than food for the pups. The warrior waited outside the cave, hoping for his son to return, but he never did. Because only a freaking idiot sends a seven year old into a cave to fight a pissed off wolf."

Nontheless, we obeyed and continued to follow him into the building. The first room was a plain reception area. the receptionist stood up from her computer and gave us guest passes. They were made of an odd material. One or two others seemed to notice this but the rest just glossed over it. We were led past the well lit areas containing the labs and offices to a dark corner that' s very much been lacking upkeep. Tucked there was a service elevator. It was cramped, and I did n' t particularly mind being pushed up against the women who were dolled up for this occasion. Our tour guide was giddy.

It' s hard to point out exactly when things changed, more and more jobs became obsolete, basic income was introduced, the era of creativity, learning, of the human spirit free from labor did not last long. uprisings, extremist ideologies, the human spirit was reluctant to accept absolute freedom from carnal responsibilities. it aspired to change, grow and take part of the world. That lead to the creation of mandatory government programs that would put the unemployed into work. It started with community services, working with children, gardening. but as the useful workforce dwindled and replaced by machines there was a need to create a more reliable mean to keep people occupied. Originally it was a piece of software that was designed to create a parallel market where people would produce widgets of no tangible value. fake products. it employed people from every facet of the workforce. useless marketers, useless factory line works, useless managers. mankind was being slowly turned into a play, reenacting their own former lifestyle. People started to fight back, the machines, which already controlled food, healthcare, policing did what they were designed to do. naturally they were not allowed to kill or arrest without anyone breaking the law. but they were allowed to deny service to \" problematic' ' customers. people started dying, and eventually started to comply. At some point the machines decided manufacturing actual widgets is redundant, there was no value to the process beyond simply going to work, that sufficed to pacify a reasonable size of the population. they were only required to go through the motions of going to work, sitting at their desks and pretending to work. for that they were paid basic income and given health care. Dale did n' t care. He was alive, the feat of human endurance for his time, to simply be alive."

Birds were chirping gently, a soft breeze was rustling. Thomas smiled like he always did. The simple joy of nature was still as fresh and acute as it had been that first day. Of course it was. That' s how he had meta-programmed his mind. Occasionally, in irregular intervals, Guardian would make the satisfaction vanish, to make him experience other possibilities, to check if this was still the paradise he ultimately preferred. Usually he returned to this private universe within a week. Thomas could spend entire months under this tree, listening to the semi-random noise of nature. Occasionally taking the perspective of a fish. Or a bug. Or the very tree he was lying under. Today, however, was n' t meant to be spend in solitude. Gabriel and Hc41 had asked for him to come visit in one of the Consensual Public Open Spaces. A new combined linear accelerator/warp bubble instigator had just been finished and millions of sophonts would come together to observe and celebrate the first firing. Consensual Spaces were n' t always easy. Only a small minority of people were currently in human body archetypes. Many experienced life as animals. Or group minds. Or abstract multidimensional waveforms. Finding a Consensual Space that fitted all of their preferences could be a challenge. Hc41 for instance was currently a cloud of gas. An endless opportunity for fart jokes. ( Humanity, as a whole, had briefly discussed optimising away the proclivity for bad puns, but than decided against it ) Thomas smiled. Today was the first day of eternity. He had a feeling it would be a good one."

He wonders how long it will take until they notice he is gone, but he knows by that time it will be much too late. A splash nearby startles the sailor out of his panic, and fresh fear fills his veins. “ What was that? ” he wonders aloud, his muscles tensing as his body prepares to defend himself. He treads water in a circle, assessing his surroundings, when he sees the eyes of a young woman peer curiously out of the water a few feet in front of him. Her skin is pale, almost translucent, and she has dark black hair that has a shimmer, almost as if it was reflecting the water around her. Her eyes are a deep, enchanting blue, and they look at the young sailor curiously, mischievously. “ Why did you want me to come back? ” she asks. Her voice is so melodic, it sounds like she is singing. He hears a splash again and he realizes that it is not a fish he heard before. It was a mermaid. Her long, deep green tail flutters powerfully in the water as she keeps herself afloat. The sailor is speechless, unsure how to respond - he is completely enchanted by her. “ Perhaps you wanted to join me? ” she asks playfully, holding her hand out for the sailor.

The unlucky ones who were caught outside the first time looked like they' d been sandblasted to death when we found them, and that probably was n' t too far from the truth. I' m praying for a food ration. The campus police seized control about three days ago, seeing as they were the only ones with weapons of any sort. They' ve stockpiled all the food in a warehouse not far from here, and they' ve been distributing it as they see fit. A few girls have been taking care of me, but I' m probably gon na die. Broken legs are a bitch. As far as we can tell, there' s no life here. Everything' s just red dust and stone. A few groups have tried looking for water, but most come back with nothing, and some do n' t come back at all. Soon, we' ll be down to drinking from the toilet bowls. But here' s the thing - something happened last night. A giant black pillar appeared on the horizon. It' s impossible to tell how far away it is or how big it is. There' s been rumors that the police are mounting some sort of expedition to try and reach it. I hope I do n' t die before they decide what to do. I' ve had a few doses of antibiotics, so hopefully I wo n' t die of infection anytime soon. Still hurts like a bitch, though. More tomorrow."

If loving Meredith is wrong then I don ’ t want to be right! The weight of the last few days lifted off of my shoulders as I finally gave into the inevitable, loving Meredith. I hopped in my car and sped towards her building, tears almost filling my eyes. I leapt out of the car and bounded through the front door. “ Meredith! ” was the only thing I could say upon seeing her beautiful face again. She did not say a word, but she always had been a little bit shy. I don ’ t mind taking the initiative though, so I began to kiss her just like old times.

When the Germans dropped their first Atom bomb, Mitternacht, on August 8th, 1942 bombing London into nothing, the American machine, in proper fashion, plunged trillions of dollars into building nuclear deterrents. Mitternacht was an experimental bomb, now knowing that it worked, the Germans put everything into completing three more. It ended for them, like it ended for us. In 1945, we tested our Buddy Blue bomb in New Mexico. It was a purpose build cannon the took up an entire B-53 frame, it used 11 pounds of fissile materials in a beryllium sphere, compressed to insane pressurize with radium gas, and the shot wit the cannon. The math showed that we needed ridiculous amounts of nuclear material to get the bomb to work. We were wrong. On July 6, 1945 Buddy Blue was fired in an old airframe on top a purpose built tower. No one who was at the test range survived. If they had detonated it any closer to the project facility - I ca n' t even imagine. better math, in 1948, estimated the destructive power at 6 gigatonnes of TNT. The atmosphere over a tenth of the U.S.A. was lit on fire, and ejected into space. Tens of Thousands died. Ironically. The German people, so horrified by the destruction in London and New Mexico staged a violent revolt against the Nazi party, many in the army joining, along with massive Jew populations from camps, and ended the war. The Soviets vowed never to build the bombs, and the Japanese even withdrew from Manchuria for fear of atomic reprisal. No one ever wished to see the power of the Atom harnessed in war, never again."

People panicked as they woke up, as people normally will do when they wake up to see a strange black mark that was n' t there last night. Initially, the tattoos were a source of great speculation. Were they symbols of things to come? Symbols representing life purposes? It took a few weeks for coroners ( who cataloged the tattoos for fun ) to realize that the tattoos showed how someone would die. From there, the news spread like wildfire. It started to change how everyone saw the world. Judy, who loved to interact with sea animals, wo n' t even step close to a lake now. Others, like Phillip, continued to enjoy their lives and even open their arms to fate, as Phillip re-enrolled in the army. I, however have a problem. When you ask me what my tattoo is, I tell you it' s in the shape of a bed. A natural death, the most sought after death type. Or death by intercourse. I' m not too sure. The main problem here, however, is that I do n' t. I do n' t have a tattoo. At first, I thought it meant that my death was imminent. I mourned by myself ( which was exacerbated with my girlfriend leaving me ) before I realized that I was n' t dead. The second phase of my realizing my lack of a tattoo was that of huge joy. I thought I was immortal. I began to engage in activities that I would normally never do; I did sky diving, BASE jumping, anything to flaunt off my ( supposed immortality ) Then I calmed down, and I started to think about the future. This immortality was awesome, but what would I do with it? What can I do with it? That' s why we' re here. You' re the only other person I' ve ever meet who does n' t have the tattoo.

I had given them free thought, the ability to be as critical as I, and I enjoyed seeing the fleas trying to utilize it in their own limited capacity.

It did n' t turn out that way. Unfortunately, there seemed to be some quite hard limits on how time travel worked. We do n' t pretend to understand the physics, but it works like this. 1. You can not travel into the future. 2. You can not travel more than sixty seconds into the past. 3. You can not travel within sixty seconds, in either direction, of another machine firing. 4. Your location is remains constant to your previous position. 5. Your velocity remains constant to your previous velcoity. We would never see the Pyramids in all their glory. We could never even be able to win a bet at the races. However, it turns out NASA was very interested in our little machine, due to that fourth little dot point. You see, the earth is travelling fast. Very fast. In fact, we do n' t even know how fast it was travelling. We wo n' t know until tomorrow. You see, we have no way of calculating the absolute velocity of an object as there is no static reference point. However, with our technology, and its ability to displace something based on its absolute position - well, now we have our absolute reference point, and with this we can determine our absolute velocity. However, this, while very interesting, is n' t the main point of what we are doing, and here we come to number five. At the moment, it costs a huge amount of money to get something into orbit. With our new technology we will be able to put something into orbit around the sun at a fraction of the current cost - and if we need it around earth, we just put some small thrusters and send it to us. From tomorrow, humanity will no longer be bound to this small blue marble. From tomorrow, we will take our rightful place amongst the stars."

Sure it was one thing to live on a campus designed by an occultist but everything that happened, from the Lake Foundation forums to the portal to *her*, that pretty redheaded librarian whose mind worked as fast as my own and whose skill in both magic and physics were things I wished for myself. It was all so tantalizing, especially her, that I just wanted to know more about them and about this crazy world of magic. That' s why I stayed the extra year to complete that Art History minor I decided to take but even poring over my college library' s amazing collection of books and taking all these courses dealing with ancient artifacts and stuff still left me with more questions. My attempt at looking up the Metropolitan Public Library led me to a building in New York even though she said they worked out of Portland. That' s why I took a job at a library and museum near me because A. I needed to look for grad schools with good physics programs, B. they might know something and C. if I could be around ancient artifacts all the time, I might see them, and her, again. One day I was looking through some old medieval texts and I came across a description of a sword, a sword once worn by one of the greatest knights in the world and believed to have been the source of his incredible power, a sword that had not been seen for centuries. If that did n' t sound like the perfect thing to lure in the sort of librarians who battled interdimensional monsters, I do n' t know what did. And so I set to work finding as many clues and texts as I could for information about the sword so I could get a bead on its location. The world was full of magic and I wanted to truly be a part of it all, and that started with getting a bigger taste of it. Soon the world will know the name Lucy Lyons, and maybe then, once she sees what I' ve done for her, she might finally accept that fate brought us together that day on campus and it never meant for us to be apart."

When finally she crossed to soft dirt once again, she half-collapsed in relief and burrowed in the moist ground, accepting its cool embrace. She quickly gave up that comfort and began munching on the closest blade of grass in desperate hunger. As she finished, she wiggled back and forth, up and down, probing the feel of her body with motion. Her journey was done, and fraught with danger it had certainly been. Surely the change would occur soon. So she waited in a dainty patch of flowers nearby. And waited. And beauty never emerged to juxtapose that bleak landscape she had just crossed.

When it all began, the army would crush the rebels but each defeat only fuled their cause and soon, they had an army of their own, nobility had begun supporting their cause, providing weapons, trained men and supplies and as the war raged on, more nobels allied with the rebellion. The capital city had fallen three days ago, when the gatemen revealed who' s side they had taken. Once inside the walls of the city, the rebels found support from all within: peasants rejoyced, merchants welcomed them, soldiers salluted them and the King' s Knights, his own personal guard, knelt before the rebel army, with only one man remaining by the King and his family. After that, it was only a matter of time before the castle fell into their hands and the king was slain in his throne room; he was not given the dignity of a formal execution, his family however, were. The queen had been executed on the first day of the new regeim, the Prince and his newly-wed bride on the second and now, finally, on the third day it was the turn of the Princess and the one Knight. As the Princess made her way to the gallows, a fate that her father had sentenced so many to, her Knight began to shield her from the mob. \" DEATH! !' ' the crowd began to roar and as missiles began to fly, her Knight raised his cloak and shield to protect her from the barrage. She did n' t even know the man' s name and he was shielding her, when he could have better protected himself. When they reached the gallows, two more knights approached him and dragged him away, he knew his fate as did the Princess, now at the foot of the Gallows, resigned to her fate."

The team, and ultimately humanity' s greater scientific community, turned to learning the nature of The Pattern found at the very fabric of the universe. A decade of study revealed a startling truth: The Pattern proves that the universe is a sophisticated simulation. All doubt was removed when it was used to predict quantum events. The twenty-first century was marked by decades of sociopolitical upheaval as humanity came to grip with the truth of our nature. In those early days, much was forgotten as we began to learn to manipulate the Pattern. From the start, we sought to contact the makers of the universe. The earliest efforts at manipulation were attempts to draw attention. The most spectacular failure was the 2106 detonation of the world' s remaining supply of nuclear weapons in space. After that yielded no response, we set to expand. The Pattern gave us the means to reach the stars. We learned to change the laws of the universe in small spaces. Ships could race across the galaxy simply by changing the speed of light in a small pocket of space-time. Instantaneous communication followed shortly. Humanity became immortal and learned to share memory and thoughts without giving up privacy and individuality. For ten thousand years, we spread across the universe. With trillions of trillions of minds focused on the task, a new plan for contact was conceived. We have recreated The Pattern with stars, and again with black holes.

And just the same, he knew that he could not allow the monster to feed while the boy was asleep, or something bad would happen.

James might not get much sleep tonight, but he would be safe from the shadow that wanted his dreams. It would give up, soon, starving itself out.

Between all the diaper changes, runny noses and scraped knees that he tended to in his adolescence, by 15 Jared figured he was already more a father than he ever wanted to be. While he abhorred the idea of bringing life into the world, he jumped at any opportunity that would potentially create it. Sex was Jared' s modus operandi. Since college, Jared had developed an impressive network of relationships with partners that valued him as a person and as a means to an end. Jared was happy to oblige. He provided his own condoms. He checked their expiration dates. He checked them for holes. He would tie them in knots and take them when he left. He bought plan be when he was even a little uncertain. Jared did *not* want kids. While he loved the peace of mind that safe sex awarded, Jared could n' t deny how nice it felt to go bareback every so often. Even if it meant dropping an extra 50 quid for a morning after pill. Naturally, when the emergency broadcast came on announcing the end of the world, Jared threw caution to the wind. With the new information, Jared vowed to spend the rest of his life doing what he loved to do, the way he loved to do it. Jared woke up post Doomsday as shocked as everyone else but quite a bit more dehydrated. Updates in the news confirmed that the asteroid threat mentioned the previous day had been dispelled as a false alarm. Jared blood ran cold. He thought back to the previous day. He remembered whipped cream stained sheets. He remembered Fuzzy hand cuffs. He remembered little blue pills, scented lotions, and The Weeknd. He did n' t remember condoms. Jared' s hand trembled as he opened his mobile bank account. His eyes began to well, his unfallen tears reflecting the red over draft notification that popped up on screen. Jared set his phone on the table and began to pace the floor of his studio apartment. On pill would set him back $ 50, not that he had it to spend. How many had he slept with? He could hardly hear his own thoughts over the sound of his pounding heart, so it' s easy to see how he missed the 43 separate text alerts that chimed on his phone. Jared did n' t know it yet, but they all said the same thing. Jared was going to be a father. Jared never wanted kids."

Opening the fridge, I squint at the meager selection of breakfast food. The strawberries are beginning to grow mold at the bottom of the container, but they' re salvageable. By the time I' ve cut the stems off of the edible fruit, my boyfriend has still not left the shower. What a waste of water. It must have been at least half an hour now. My mood is growing decidedly sour as I pop a berry into my mouth. Then my heart jumps into my throat. Whirling around dizzily, I clutch my chest, begin beating it with my fist, trying to cough. Each attempt to inhale seems to lodge the fruit even more solidly into my throat. I' m not breathing. My screams are locked in my mouth with the blockage, resistant to my weakening attempts to claw through the skin on my neck and then through my mouth. As I blindly stumble into the other room and begin banging on the bathroom door I hear the distant sounds of my boyfriend singing through the thundering echo of water hitting the porcelain. I' m beating, clawing at the door, and he continues his performance unaware to the horror unfolding a few feet away. He ca n' t hear the death rattle of my strangled breath as my esophagus closes, and I begin to realize that my life is about to end here below the bathroom door, here on this carpet I had so meticulously picked only about a week ago. It had seemed so important then. My heartbeat is pounding in my ears, amplifying the scream of dying brain. My anti-climactic last moments on a monday morning. I feel the blood vessels in my eyes pop, and my vision starts to fade. The last thing I see is my bleeding hands, fingernails torn back from vicious pleading with the door to let me in.

Thankfully, the inhabitants on this planet look no different than Earth people, and I was able to assimilate myself into the community in no time at all. The planet is really small, it probably has a circumference of less than 20 miles. As such, the gravitational pull is much lesser, just about enough to keep my feet on the ground if I tread with care. And in turn, my bones and muscles are much denser than the locals. Their buildings are soft and light, and can barely survive my weight if I go too high up. Their cars are made of cardboard. I ’ ve been to one of their gymnasiums, the heaviest weight they have is exactly one pound. And the police department use guns that fire plastic bullets, the ones Earth kids play with. To me they ’ re harmless, but to them they ’ re lethal. I ’ ve decided to use my strength and abilities for a good cause. I once stopped a cardboard truck from running into a crowd. Held the roof of a styrofoam house so people could escape before it collapsed on them. Apprehended a bunch of robbers with my bare hands. The people adored me, erected statues of me and even ran a TV show detailing my adventures. The women loved me, though I had to be careful not to break their bones when reciprocating my love. But on this day, everything changed. I woke up after a careful lovemaking session to turn on the TV, ready to indulge myself with the people ’ s adoration and worship. Yet, all I could see was news with vague images of towns going up in smoke. Trails of destruction everywhere. This was something the local police could never handle, and I knew I was needed. I ran there as fast as I could and got there in a few minutes. It was chaos, everywhere. I saw a police sergeant badly wounded on the floor and tended to him, and in his dying breath, he begged me to stop the monsters in red armor. I ventured further down the street, the smoke clears, and I saw a bunch of burly, menacing looking humanoids laying waste to everything in sight. The school ’ s football team had arrived."

Its clever how red is Mars and blue is Earth, since red/blue are frequently used to show opposing sides. Also, I really like the line \" quit loving the Earth and love me instead! \" The journal bot is pretty cool too. Plot-wise, the story seems like this is incomplete because the beginning states that the lovers are dead, but this ends without us knowing how that happens.

Something he had never noticed before. Finally, he reached his car. Unlocking the door, he placed his briefcase in the passenger seat. He thought of his daughter and of his wife. He thought of all the hours of work, and how it had finally got him to the point he was today. He replayed in his mind what his boss said to him, You are getting a promotion, no more floor work for you now, now you will manage your own branch of factories. You are your own boss now. As John turned the ignition nothing happened. After five twists, the Taurus sputtered to life. If there was a form of car bronchitis, this car was definitely patient zero. After the drive home, John was ready to unwind in his small apartment with his family. By the end of the month, John would never step foot in that beat down car, or that run down apartment again.

Followed swiftly by those haunting words was a new addition to my torso: steel. As I lay here, dying, I watch the pair run off into the forest up ahead. In those final moments a phrase uttered in my head for what seemed like a thousand years, \" May the odds be ever in your favour' '."

Kennedy, in times of great indecision, had dispersed his cabinet to \" consult the juju' '. It is assumed it had something to do with the button.

I' d sat with the ranger' s assistant for almost an hour, waiting for the strikers to get into gear; with no reception on my phone, we' d got to know each other quite well. After shooting the shit for awhile, I remarked that it was almost time for the demonstration to begin. For an assistant, the kid knew quite a bit; he warned me against using flash photography ( which I told him would n' t be a problem and tried to explain to him for the fifth time that I was a *journalist* ) and told me to not piss off the activists. \" They might look like a bunch of skinny hippies' ', he started, \" but man do they pack a punch! Especially the chicks, pretty surprising, really. \" I thanked him for his advice and kept my cynical responses to myself and made for the tree that the demonstration was to be taking place at. .. and there she was. I snapped myself out of the stupid daydream as soon as I realised I was in it. I was n' t going to think about her any more. I' d done what I had to do and now it was over. I had n' t left a trace of DNA, not a single clue that could lead anyone to even suspect me for the fire. But she' d know. The forest I met her in, proposed to her in, everything. And she' d suffer. Mission accomplished. *Footnote: the blue-ish light to the right of the picture. I know it' d more than likely go the other way if it was a phone being thrown, but I wanted to work it into the story somehow."

Next to him on the bench there was an unopened loaf of bread. I sat down on the opposite side of the bench, glanced over at the older gentleman and saw tears in his eyes. I realized then I had no clue what to say or how to help, so I just sat and waited. After what felt like an eternity of uncomfortable silence he finally spoke up. “ It was our tradition.

Everybody stood together and helped the Russians put things back together.

Brazil' s economy was booming and the other countries in South America were benefiting from it. Everyone seemed optimistic. Then it happened. It' s an old story really. Repeated time and time again throughout history. A leader with fire in his gut and silver tongue takes power. He promises a better stronger nation. And he seems to really follow through. The nation that was in decay was once again on the rise. Technology was advancing faster there than any where else. Asteroid mining, missile defense, renewable energy, stem cell therapy, lasers and so many other things were created. Most people did n' t care too much about the' traitors' who got arrested. Everything was better, their kids had a bright future and they had pride again. We should really have paid more attention, but everything was so good. When they demanded that the weaker nation bordering them give up territory we were shocked. They said it was theirs, it had always been theirs. It was obvious they were going to fight for it. So the UN stepped in and gave it to them. Everyone smiled and shook hands. War had once again been averted. Then they decided that a measly province was n' t enough. Sanctions, oh sanctions. They hurt us more than it hurt them. Within a few years their economy was just fine and completely independent. Then the first troops dropped in Britain. They said they were righting an ancient wrong. We knew that we could n' t stand for it. So like in the days of old, a great alliance formed to fight the warmongers. But something was wrong. This was n' t a smaller nation fighting against the industrial giants. We were many but they were so strong. In the peace, we had grown lax.

Broken windows of the mom-and-pops run by people who could n' t read the labels of the food they sold, gazebo by the lake where Elizabeth rejected my great-grandmother' s ring, the old drive-in that used to run those sentimental crap films. And they all called me crazy. Why you gon na spend all your money on cement and beans, Jack? HA! Warned' em not to trust that Putin fella. Now who' s the one skipping down Main butt-naked wearing the Mayor' s cowboy hat, Aunt Marjorie? Another great day, Jackie boy. I head up for a sunset dinner at Overlook before another glorious night of undisturbed sleep. The sky is burning indigo and red from the fires in the valley. So beautiful I could cry if the air was n' t so dry. I enjoy my meal and get down to the last delicious potato with cheddar cheese. \" Wait! \" A voice shouts from behind me. I lower the potato. The tears flow easy now."

He considered the discomfort of the old folks accompanying him, but quickly dismissed the thought. They would complete their glorious service to the state soon. Nearby, a loud hailer blared reassurances of glory and honor. \" In service to our Great Leader' ', among other things. Arno silently repeated the words to himself as they were spoken, and sneered to himself. Whatever words they used to uplift the people' s spirits did n' t matter. Arno only saw fear and resignation written on their faces. **** As the plane took off and reached cruising altitude, Arno undid his restraints and paced up and down the hold. He noticed one of the folks had fallen asleep, his head nodding between the restraints as the plane bobbed up and down erratically. He took a few steps forward and gently shook him awake. A wave of relief overcame Arno as the old man awoke, startled and wide-eyed. \" Good, he' s not gon na die yet' ', Arno thought to himself. Some of his friends were unlucky enough to get cancer patients who could n' t survive the trip. Arno' s thoughts were interrupted as an alarm pierced the deafening hum of the plane engines. It was time. Arno turned about and yelled for everyone to get up. The back door of the plane began to descend, inviting the piercing cold and the howling of the wind in to jolt the senses of even the drowsiest of the elderly. \" This is it! The Leader thanks you for your service! \", Arno cried out. \" Now get out there and make the Yankees pay! \" -- - I was thinking about adding an old couple that did n' t want to jump.

I swing in an arc, heads fall and blood spurts. The enemies keep coming. I look around me, my brethren are falling. The last of the Humans making their stand. I turn and see our King thrust his shield into a chieftain' s club, twirling and slicing his weak spots. He ducks under another blow and cuts upwards. His sword strikes the air, the chieftain side-steps his swing and brings his mighty club down onto our Majesty' s face. He crumples. Bone fragments splintering from his face. His eyes pop. The chieftain grins. They continually push us back. We fall against our last remaining gate protecting the aristocratic women and children. A monster among orcs brandishes his wicked blade, it must be 3 meters in length. Flesh still coats it' s edge. One eye is missing but he stands two heads taller than the rest of the orcs. He cries out and charges forward. Stumbling into our remaining soldiers, killing 4 or 5 with each stroke. There' s only 100 of us. Now 90. 70. 40. 10. 2. I dash in between this beast' s legs and stab up directly into his groin, he tumbles forward into the gate. It cracks underneath his weight. The enemy falters for a second. And then, they storm me and my last man. I want to run, I want to run and hide, but my last man stands strong and so shall I. I kill more than I can count, the two of us, a torrent of destruction that leaves no life behind. The orcs keep attacking, first one blow lands. Then another. I see the life flee from my last man as an orcish sword with a keen edge cuts my legs out from under me. Death beckons me into his grasp. I hear the Queen scream \" All is lost! The enemy is through the gate! \" I have failed my people."

        "first_sentence": "Time.",
        "text": "The world' s most universal currency. The universal cost. No matter what you do, what you need, where you go it will always cost you time. It' s inescapable. It' s all-consuming in its never ending march forward towards oblivion, yet all-giving in the simplest of realizations that we are privileged to recognize is value and use it. But what to use it for? You can trade time for anything, provided you have enough of it. You can spend 5 minutes to remove the garbage from your kitchen, or maybe 8 hours to buy some respite, a year to experience life in a new place, or barter for a college degree in few solar revolutions. It' s all a matter of what it is you want, and how much time you have. It' s also an interesting thought that sometimes you can *buy* time. From something as asinine as hiring someone to clean your gutters, providing you with time to do something else, or extending your life with medical procedures. But what is time worth? That is a hard question. Is it worth the $ 7. 95 per hour to work a grill at a restaurant? What of the precious moments you cherished playing catch with your father? What was the value of the 3 days you spent lying in bed with pneumonia? What are you getting in return for the next 5 minutes of your life? Is it worth it? But, like anything else you have, it can be taken. It can be scammed. It can be lost. You never really know how much you have, until the end is in sight. 2 years until the tumor does enough brain damage. A few weeks left on life support. 5 minutes until you run out of oxygen. A single moment before the train hits. The morbid punchline is that you may never know how much time you have until the ticking is right about to stop. Staring you in the face, unsympathetic in its gaze. The only thing we can do is to make sure we have spent the time we have already had wisely."

We' d debated for a long time about it, but we decided not to go after the hospital for what was an honest mistake. No point in ruining their lives for impairing Marys. Mary, bless her heart, adapted quickly even if she did mention missing colors and seeing what was outside every once in a while. The 4th of July was a special day for us, for many reasons. We are n' t particularly patriotic, but there' s something special about getting together a big group of people you love and just enjoying each others company. Every year we have nearly the entire family over, and I suspect half the neighborhood. Grills are fired up and kitchens filled, and then we all herd into our backyard to chat and eat. Mary runs around with the other kids - she' s a bit more clumsy, maybe, but she' s faster than any of them. Then dusk hits, and the kids start getting antsy. A few of the more adventurous folks get together the fireworks and trek some distance away to light' em. A few days beforehand we collect money from everyone so that we can get a decent amount, and there' s always quite a bit of variety in there. Mary likes the \" big sparkly ones' ' as she puts it. This year she was a little more down than usual. As the fireworks got set up Karen and I took her aside to comfort her. She may not be able to see the fireworks like she used to when she was little, we told her, but she could still see the bright lights. Mary did n' t seem to believe us - I would n' t have either at such a young age. I pulled her up on my shoulders and told her to tilt her head up and wait for the fireworks. She sighed that exasperated little sigh, but did as I asked. The grin that came from the streaks of light and crackling bursts will stay with me until the day I die."

        "text": "John had never been inside one of these horse-drawn things - in fact, it was unusual for him to be sitting down at all before nightfall. As the carriage moved onward and the bumpy road jostled the carriage, John thought back to that morning, when he had awakened and began the day like any other. John was a peasant, born to a lineage of peasants. Each morning he would rise, and it being the summertime, would follow his father and brothers out into the fields for another day of labor. But today had been different - around noon, the carriage had drawn up, and a man dressed in fanciful clothing asked to speak with John' s father. The men talked for several minutes, then the outsider gave John' s father a small sack and motioned for John to come over. The man was in service of the Crown and had chosen John for his size and strength. Of all his brothers, John was the tallest and could work the hardest. John was to leave immediately to travel to the throne' s seat and begin his service. John said goodbye to his family and got inside the carriage. The carriage jerked sharply as it slipped a wheel into a rut, bringing John back into the current moment. The man from earlier sat opposite John, staring out the window of the carriage. \" It' s fortunate we found a man such as yourself so quickly, \" the man said. John was n' t so able with words, and he preferred to be silent anyway. The man continued, \" The Queen sent us out last night, she was so anxious to have this matter settled. \" John looked down at his hands - leathery and cracked from years of hard labor. \" With the unusual occurrences among the kingdom, it' s no wonder she' s anxious, \" the man said. John looked out the window and saw a man working in a field suddenly collapse. John remained silent. The man leaned over and latched the door to the carriage shut, then opened a small sliding door above his head and told the driver to double up speed. A whip cracked, and the carriage jerked forward and then hurried its pace. \" We' re about to pass through one of the troubled spots, John, so keep your wits about you and wait for my orders. \" John looked back out the window. John wished he' d just have stayed to tend the potatoes."

The Supreme Leader will release me on one condition. ” Pubs across the country fell silent with anticipation. In the suburbs, mothers told their children to stop watching and go upstairs. In the city, stockbrokers told would-be traders to wait. In former colonial possessions, telemarketers put the people they were talking to on hold. “ The Supreme Leader, ” the Queen said, reading from cue cards, “ invites all living recipients of the Order of the British Empire to attend this year ’ s Arirang Mass Games in Pyongyang. ” Her voice trembled. She knew she was asking too much. “ The Arirang Mass Games are the greatest show on earth. At five years old, the most talented gymnasts in Korea enter the guild of the tumblers and devote their lives to the Arirang. It is the Supreme Show. ” She sobbed. “ Performers from the decadent West—those that have received a knighthood—may perform in the *Rungrado 1st of May Stadium* following the Arirang.

Him and a few others from his town, as well as a few hundred others that were from the far northern reaches of Earth. Scientists on Earth had said that it would be easier to adapt to the cold, and despite conversation starters guised as complaints about the weather, it was true. What he could n' t get used to, however, was the fact that there was no true solid ground to stand on. Sure, there was ice a mile thick, but below that was miles and miles of dark ocean. He' d have nightmares sometimes, of there being a crack in the ice, a shift, and he' d fall through. Another thing he could never really adapt to was the wind. The young Europa had few features on its surface. A few craters from impacts, but that was about all. This allowed the wind to whip across the surface, driving the settlers into partially underground, sturdy buildings. There were tunnels under the ice that connected many of the buildings. Walking on the surface was reserved for the strong and healthy, like him. Workers on the surface would repair buildings, repair equipment, and send probes into the ocean looking for information. For life. That' s what they had been sent there for. That was the bottom line of this mission. But, throughout the years of the cold, the ice cracks that lead to deaths, and food shortages, he' d come to the conclusion that there was no life on Europa. Not anymore."
